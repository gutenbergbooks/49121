<h2>DEDICATION</h2>

<p class="center"> TO<br />
VICE-ADMIRAL POTTIER<br />
<i>Commander-in-Chief of the Squadron of the Far East</i><br />
</p>


<p>
<span class="smcap">Admiral</span>:&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>The notes which I sent to the "Figaro" from China are
to be collected in a volume which will be published in Paris
before my return, so that it will be impossible for me to look
it over. I am therefore a little uneasy as to how such a collection
may turn out; it will doubtless contain much repetition.
Yet I beg that you will accept this dedication as a token of the
profound and affectionate respect of your first aide-de-camp.
You will be more indulgent than any one else, because you
know under what conditions it was written,&mdash;from day to day
during a painful campaign in the midst of the continual excitement
of life aboard ship.</p>

<p>I have restricted myself to noting the things which have
come under my own observation while undertaking the missions
to which you assigned me, and in the course of the journey
which you allowed me to take into a certain part of China
hitherto almost unknown.</p>

<p>When we reached the Yellow Sea, Pekin had been taken,
and the war was over. I could, therefore, only observe our
soldiers during the period of peaceful occupation. Under
these circumstances I have seen them always kind and almost
fraternal in manner toward the humblest of the Chinese. May
my book contribute its small part toward destroying the
shameful stories published against them!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps you may reproach me, Admiral, for saying almost
nothing of the sailors who remained on our ships, who were
constantly toiling with never a murmur or a loss of courage
during our long and dangerous sojourn in the waters of
Petchili. Poor sequestered beings living between steel walls!
They did not have, to sustain them, as their superiors had,
any of the responsibilities which make up the interest of life,
or the stimulus that comes from having to decide serious questions.
They knew nothing, they saw nothing, not even the
sinister coast in the distance. In spite of the heat of a
Chinese summer, fires were burning day and night in their
stifling quarters; they lived bathed in a moist heat, dripping
with perspiration, coming out only for exhausting drill-work
in small boats, in bad weather, and often in the dead of night
and on boisterous seas.</p>

<p>One needs but a glance at their thin pale faces now, to
understand how difficult their obscure rôle has been.</p>

<p>But if I had told of the monotony of their hardships, and
of their silent unending devotion, no one would have had the
patience to read me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span></p>

<h2>TRANSLATOR'S NOTE</h2>


<p>The account of his experiences in China,
published by Pierre Loti under the title
of "Les Derniers Jours de Pékin," first
appeared in the form of letters written to the
"Figaro" from China, from notes taken on the spot
during those memorable days when he was serving
on board one of the French warships.</p>

<p>Loti has written little of late, having had no end of
trouble with his naval superiors, through jealousy,
it is said, of his literary success.</p>

<p>As Julian Viaud, Loti ranks in the navy as
"Lieutenant de vaisseau." Some time ago he was
abruptly retired. He took his case before the
"Conseil d'état," which finally gave a verdict in his
favor, and he secured the nomination of officier
d'ordonnance at the time of the Chinese difficulties,
during which he resumed his literary work neglected
in a measure on account of the tribulations connected
with his naval career.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span></p>

<p>His account of his experiences in China is very
personal and very national, yet, exotic that it is, it
presents such a vivid picture of certain phases of
China that it is of value as the contribution of
an observer possessing sympathy, imagination, and
knowledge, as well as the literary sense, to the history
of our own times.</p>

<h2>I<br />
THE ARRIVAL IN THE YELLOW SEA</h2>


<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Monday</span>, Sept. 24, 1900.<br />
</div>

<p>Very early morning, on a calm sea and
under a starry sky. A light on the eastern
horizon shows that day is about to break,
yet it is still night. The air is soft and moist.&mdash;Is
it the summer of the North, or the winter of a
warm climate? Nothing in sight on any side, no
land, no light, no sail, no indication of any place&mdash;just
a marine solitude in ideal weather and in
the mystery of the wavering dawn.</p>

<p>Like a leviathan which conceals itself in order
to surprise, the big iron-clad advances silently with
determined slowness, its engines barely revolving.</p>

<p>It has just covered five thousand miles almost
without pausing to breathe, constantly making
forty-eight turns of the screw to a minute, accomplishing
without stopping and without damage
of any sort, and without much wear and
tear of its substantial machinery, the longest journey,
at the highest rate of sustained speed, that a
monster of its size has ever undertaken, thus defeating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
in this important test ships reputed to be
faster, and which at first sight might be thought
superior in speed.</p>

<p>This morning it has arrived at the end of its
journey, it is about to reach a part of the world
whose name but yesterday was unknown, but
toward which the eyes of Europe are now turning.
This sea, where the morning light is calmly
breaking, is the Yellow Sea, it is the gulf of Petchili,
from which one reaches Pekin. An immense
fighting squadron must already be assembled
very near us, although as yet nothing indicates
its vicinity.</p>

<p>We have been two or three days crossing this
Yellow Sea in beautiful September weather. Yesterday
and the day before, junks with sails of matting
have crossed our route, on their way to Corea;
shores and islands more or less distant have appeared,
but at the present moment the entire circle
of the horizon is empty.</p>

<p>Since midnight we have been moving slowly,
in order that our expected arrival in the midst of
this fleet of ships&mdash;which is to be attended with
obligatory military pomp&mdash;should not take place
at too early an hour.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Five o'clock. Out of the semi-obscurity sounds
the music of the reveille, the gay trumpeting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
which each morning arouses the sailors. It is
earlier than usual, so that there may be ample
time to perform the toilet of the iron-clad, which
has lost some of its freshness during forty-five
days at sea. We still see nothing but empty space,
and yet the lookout, from his post aloft, reports
black smoke on the horizon. This small cloud of
coal smoke, which from below looks like nothing,
betokens a formidable presence; it is produced by
great steel ships, it is the breath of this unprecedented
squadron which we are about to join.</p>

<p>Before the ship's toilet comes that of the crew.
Barefooted and bare-chested, the sailors splash in
the water in the dawning light. In spite of continual
hard work, they are no more tired than the
ship that carries them. The <i>Redoutable</i> is, of all
the ships that departed so suddenly, the only one
which has had neither death nor sickness on board,
even in crossing the Red Sea.</p>

<p>Now the sun has risen clear above the horizon,
a yellow disk which slowly climbs upward from
behind the quiet waters. For us, who have just
left equatorial regions, this rising, luminous as it
is, has I know not what of melancholy and of dulness,
which savors of autumn and a northern climate.
Really in two or three days the sun has
changed. Now it no longer burns, it is no longer
dangerous, we cease to fear it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>In front of us, from out the cloud of coal
smoke, far-off objects begin to emerge, perceptible
only to the eye of the mariner; a forest of spears,
one should say, planted away off at the end of
space, almost beyond the range of vision. We
know what they are,&mdash;the giant chimneys, the
heavy fighting masts, the terrible paraphernalia of
warfare, which, with the smoke, reveal from afar
the modern squadron. When our morning cleaning
is over, when everything has been washed with
buckets of sea water, the <i>Redoutable</i> increases her
speed to the average of eleven and a half knots an
hour, which she has maintained since her departure
from France. And while the sailors are busy making
the brass and copper shine, she begins again to
trace her deep furrow through the tranquil waters.</p>

<p>Objects on the smoky horizon line begin to
stand forth and take shape. Below the innumerable
masts, masses of every form and color are
distinguishable. These are the ships themselves.
Between the calm water and the pale sky lies the
whole terrible company, an assemblage of strange
monsters, some white and yellow, others white
and black, others the color of slime or of fog, in
order to make them less easily distinguishable.
Their backs are humped and their sides half submerged
and hidden like big uneasy turtles. Their
structures vary according to the conceptions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
different persons in regard to engines of destruction,
but all alike breathe forth horrible coal smoke,
which dulls the morning light.</p>

<p>No more of the coast of China is visible than if
we were a thousand leagues away or than if it did
not exist. Yet we are close to Taku, the meeting-place
toward which for so many days our minds
have been bent. It is China, close by although invisible,
which attracts by its nearness this herd of
beasts of prey, and which keeps them as immovable
as fallow deer at bay, at this precise point on
the seas, until some one speaks the word.</p>

<p>The water, here where it is less deep, has lost
its beautiful blue, to which we have so long been
accustomed, and has become troubled and yellow,
and the sky, although cloudless, is decidedly melancholy.
Our first impression of this whole scene,
of which we shall undoubtedly for a long time
form a part, is one of sadness.</p>

<p>But now as we draw nearer and the sun rises
there is a change, and the beautiful shining iron-clads
with their many-colored flags begin to stand
out. It is indeed a remarkable squadron that
here represents Europe,&mdash;Europe armed against
gloomy old China. It occupies an infinite amount
of space, the whole horizon seems crowded with
ships, and small boats&mdash;little steam tugs&mdash;hurry
like busy people among the big motionless vessels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Now cannon on all sides begin a military welcome
for our admiral, beneath the heavy curtain
of black smoke; the gay light smoke from powder
blossoms like sheaves and goes off in white masses,
while up and down the iron masts the tricolor
rises and falls in our honor. Everywhere trumpets
sound, foreign bands play our Marseillaise,&mdash;one
is more or less intoxicated with this ceremonial,
always the same yet always superb, which
here borrows an unaccustomed magnificence on
account of the display of the fleet.</p>

<p>And now the sun is at last awake and shining,
adding to the day of our arrival a last illusion of
midsummer heat, in this country of extreme seasons;
in two months' time it will begin to freeze
up for a long winter.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When evening comes, our eyes, which will
weary of it soon enough, are feasted upon a
grand fairy-like spectacle, given for us by the
squadron. Suddenly electric lights appear on all
sides, white, or green, or red, twinkling and sparkling
in a dazzling manner; the big ships, by means
of a play of lights, converse with one another, and
the water reflects thousands of signals, thousands
of lights, while the rockets race for the horizon or
pass through the sky like delirious comets. One
forgets all that breeds death and destruction in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
this phantasmagoria, and for the moment feels
oneself in the midst of a great city, with towers,
minarets, palaces, improvised in this part of the
world especially for this extravagant nocturnal
celebration.</p>

<div class="right">
September 25.<br />
</div>

<p>It is only the next day and yet everything is
different. A breeze came up in the morning,&mdash;hardly
a breeze, just enough to spread over the
sea big vague plumes of smoke. Already furrows
are being made in this open and not very deep
roadstead, and the small boats, continually going
and coming, bob up and down bathed in spray.</p>

<p>A ship with the German colors appears upon
the horizon just as we appeared yesterday; it is
immediately recognized as the <i>Herta</i>, bringing
Field-Marshal von Waldersee, the last one of the
military commanders expected at this meeting-place
of the Allies. The salutes that yesterday
were for us, begin anew for him, the whole magnificent
ceremony is repeated. Again the cannon
give forth clouds of smoke, mingling tufts of white
with the denser variety, and the national air of
Germany is taken up by all the bands, and borne
on the rising wind.</p>

<p>The wind whistles stronger, stronger and colder;
a bad autumn wind, that plays about the whalers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and the tugs, which yesterday circulated readily
among the various groups of the squadron.</p>

<p>It presages difficult days for us, for in this uncertain
harbor, which in an hour's time becomes
dangerous, we shall have to land thousands of
soldiers sent from France and thousands of tons
of war supplies. Many people and many things
must be moved over this rough water, in barges
or in small boats, in the cold and even in the
night, and must be taken to Taku across the river's
changing bar.</p>

<p>To organize this long and perilous undertaking
is to be our task&mdash;that of the marines&mdash;during
the first few months, an austere, exhausting, and
obscure rôle without apparent glory.</p>

<h2>II<br />
AT NING-HIA</h2>

<div class="right">
Oct. 3, 1900.<br />
</div>

<p>In the gulf of Petchili on the beach at Ning-Hia,
lighted by the rising sun. Here are
sloops, tugs, whalers, junks, their prows in
the sand, landing soldiers and war supplies at the
foot of an immense fort whose guns are silent. On
this shore there is a confusion and a babel such
as has been seen in no other epoch of history.
From these boats where so many people are
disembarking, float pell-mell all the flags of
Europe.</p>

<p>The shore is wooded with birches and willows,
and in the distance mountains with strange outlines
raise their peaks to the clear sky. There are
only northern trees, showing that the winters in
this country are cold, and yet the morning sun is
already burning; the far-off peaks are magnificently
violet, the sun shines as in Provence. Standing
about among the sacks of earth collected for the
erection of hasty defences, are all kinds of people.
There are Cossacks, Austrians, Germans, English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
midshipmen, alongside of our armed sailors; little
Japanese soldiers, with a surprisingly good military
bearing in their new European uniforms; fair
ladies of the Russian Red-Cross Society, busy
unpacking material for the ambulances; and Bersaglieri
from Naples, who have put their cock-feathers
onto colonial caps.</p>

<p>There is something about these mountains in
this sunshine, in this limpid air, that recalls the
shores of the Mediterranean on autumn mornings.
Not far away an old gray structure rises among the
trees, twisted, crooked, bristling with dragons and
monsters. It is a pagoda. The interminable line
of ramparts which winds about and finally loses
itself behind the summits of the mountains in the
distance, is the Great Wall of China, which forms
the boundary of Manchuria.</p>

<p>The soldiers who disembark barefooted in the
sand, gaily calling out to one another in all tongues,
seem to be the sort who are easily amused. What
they are doing to-day is called "a peaceful capture,"
and it seems more like a celebration of universal
fusion, of universal peace, yet not far from
here, in the vicinity of Tien-Tsin and of Pekin,
the country is in ruins and is strewn with the
dead.</p>

</div>

<p>The necessity for occupying Ning-Hia, of holding
it as a base of supplies, had been impressed
upon the admirals of the international squadron,
and day before yesterday all the ships had prepared
for a struggle, knowing that the forts on the
shore were well armed; but the Chinese who lived
here, warned by an official that a formidable company
of cuirassiers would appear at daybreak, preferred
to leave the place&mdash;so we found it deserted
on our arrival.</p>

<p>The fort which overlooks the shore and which
forms the terminus of the Great Wall at its sea
end, has been declared international.</p>

<p>The flags of the seven allied nations float there
together, arranged in alphabetical order at the
end of long poles guarded by pickets,&mdash;Austria,
France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Japan,
Russia.</p>

<p>The other forts scattered over the surrounding
heights have been apportioned, the one belonging to
France being situated about a mile from the shore.
It is reached by a dusty road, bordered with birches
and frail willows, which crosses gardens and
orchards turning brown at the same season as
our own,&mdash;gardens exactly like ours, with modest
rows of cabbages and pumpkins and long lines
of lettuce. The little wooden houses too, scattered
here and there among the trees, resemble
those of our villages, with red tiled roofs, vines
trained in garlands, and little beds of zinnias,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
asters, and chrysanthemums. It is a country
which should be peaceful, happy, yet which has in
two days' time become depopulated through fear
of the approach of the invaders from Europe.</p>

<p>On this fresh October morning the sailors and
soldiers of all nations are hurrying and skurrying
along the shaded road that leads to the French
fort, seeking the pleasures of discovery; amusing
themselves in a conquered land, catching chickens
and pilfering salads and pears from the gardens.
The Russians are taking down the Buddhas and
gilded vases from a pagoda. The English are
driving with sticks the cattle captured in the fields.
The Dalmatians and the Japanese&mdash;fast friends
of an hour's standing&mdash;are making their toilet
together on the banks of a stream, and two Bersaglieri
who have caught a little donkey are riding
it astride, almost bursting with laughter.</p>

<p>And yet the sad exodus of Chinese peasants
which began yesterday still continues; in spite of
the assurance given them that no harm would be
done to any one, those who were left felt themselves
too near and preferred to flee. Whole families
departed with bowed heads; men, women,
children, all dressed alike in blue cotton gowns,
and loaded with baggage, even the babies resignedly
carrying their little pillows and mattresses.</p>

<p>One scene was heart-breaking. An old Chinese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
woman&mdash;very, very old, perhaps a hundred years
old&mdash;who could scarcely stand up, was going,
God knows where, driven from her home, where
a company of Germans had established themselves;
she went away, dragging herself along with the
help of two young lads who may have been her
grandsons and who supported her as best they
could, looking at her with infinite respect and tenderness.
Seeming not to see us and looking as
though she had nothing further to expect from
any one, she passed slowly by, her poor face filled
with despair, with supreme and irremediable distress,
whilst the soldiers behind her were throwing
away with shouts of laughter the unpretentious
images from the altar of her ancestors. The
beautiful sunshine of the autumn morning shone
calmly on her well-cared-for little garden, blooming
with zinnias and asters.</p>

<p>The fort which fell to the lot of the French
occupies almost the space of a town with all its
dependencies, lodgings for mandarins and soldiers,
electrical work-shops, stables, and powder magazines.
In spite of the dragons that adorn the
gates and in spite of the clawed monster painted
on a stone slab in front of the entrance, it is constructed
upon the most recent principles&mdash;plastered,
casemated, and provided with Krupp guns of
the latest models. Unfortunately for the Chinese,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
who had accumulated in the vicinity of Ning-Hia
some terrifying defences,&mdash;mines, torpedoes, fougades,
and intrenched camps,&mdash;nothing was finished,
nothing completed anywhere; the movement
against foreigners began six months too soon,
before they had gotten into working order all the
material Europe had sold to Li-Hung-Chang.</p>

<p>A thousand Zouaves who are to arrive to-morrow
are to occupy this fort during the winter;
while awaiting their arrival we have simply
brought along a score of sailors to take
possession.</p>

<p>It is curious to go among these houses, abandoned
in haste and terror, and to find ourselves in
the midst of the disorder of precipitate flight;
broken furniture and dishes, clothing, guns, bayonets,
ballistic books, boots with paper soles, umbrellas,
and ambulance supplies are piled pell-mell
before the doors. In the kitchens dishes of rice
are ready for the oven, with plates of cabbage and
cakes made of fried grasshoppers.</p>

<p>There are shells everywhere, cartridges strew
the grounds, gun-cotton is dangerously dispersed,
and black powder is scattered in long trains. But
side by side with this debauch of war materials,
droll details attest the human side of Chinese life;
on all the window-sills are pots of flowers, on all
the walls are household gods placed there by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
soldiers. The familiar sparrow abounds here, and
is never interfered with, it seems, by the inhabitants
of the place, and from the roofs the cats,
circumspect but anxious to enter into relations
with us, are observing the sort of <i>ménage</i> that
will be possible with such unexpected hosts as
ourselves.</p>

<p>Very near us, a hundred metres from our fort,
passes the Great Wall of China. It is surmounted
at this point by a watch tower, where the Japanese
are now established, and there they have planted
their white flag on a bamboo stick in the red
sunlight.</p>

<p>Always smiling, especially at the French, the
little Japanese soldiers invite us to come up to see
from above the surrounding country.</p>

<p>The Great Wall, seven or eight hundred metres
thick at this point, descends gently amid green
grass on the Chinese side, but drops vertically on
the side toward Manchuria, where it is flanked
by enormous square bastions.</p>

<p>We mount, and at our feet we see the wall
plunging on one hand into the Yellow Sea, while
on the other it rises to the summits of the mountain
and goes winding on through the fields as
far as the eye can see, giving the impression
of a colossal thing which never comes to any
end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Toward the east we have a view, in this clear
light, of the deserted plains of Manchuria.</p>

<p>Toward the west&mdash;in China&mdash;the wooded
country has a deceptive look of peace and confidence.
All the European flags hoisted on the forts
have a festive air amid all the green. It is true
that on a plain near the shore there are evidences
of an immense movement of Cossacks, but they are
far away and the noise does not reach us, though
there are at least five thousand men among the
tents and among the flags which are stuck into the
ground. Where the other powers send to Ning-Hia
only a few companies, the Russians on the
contrary proceed in great masses, because of their
designs on neighboring Manchuria. Shan-Haï-Kouan,
the Tartar village which has closed its
gates through fear of pillage, appears in the distance,
gray and mute as though asleep behind its
high crenellated walls. On the sea off toward the
horizon, rests the squadron of the Allies,&mdash;a fleet
of steel monsters with black smoke, friends for the
moment, silently assembled in the motionless blue.</p>

<p>The weather is calm, exquisite, buoyant. The
prodigious rampart of China blossoms at this
season like a garden. Between its sombre bricks,
loosened by time, asters, and quantities of pinks
like those at the seashore in France are pushing
their way through.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>This legendary wall, which has for centuries
stopped all invasion from the north, will probably
nevermore see the yellow flag and the green dragon
of the Celestial emperors. Its time has gone by,
passed, is forever at an end.</p>

<h2>III<br />
ON THE WAY TO PEKIN</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Thursday</span>, Oct. 11, 1900.<br />
</div>

<p>At noon, on a beautiful calm day that is
almost warm and very luminous on the
water, I leave the admiral's ship, the <i>Redoutable</i>,
to go on a mission to Pekin.</p>

<p>We are in the gulf of Petchili on the road to
Taku, but at such a distance from the shore that
it is not visible, so there is no indication of China
anywhere.</p>

<p>The trip begins with a short ride on a steam
launch, which takes us out to the <i>Bengali</i>, the
little despatch-boat which will bring me to land
by to-night.</p>

<p>The water is softly blue in the autumn sunshine,
which is always bright in this part of the world.
To-day, by chance, the wind and the waves seem
to sleep. As far as one can see, great warships
succeed one another, motionless and menacing.
As far as the horizon there are the turrets, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
masts, the smoke of the astonishing international
squadron with all its train of satellites, torpedo
boats, transports, and a legion of packet-boats.</p>

<p>The <i>Bengali</i>, upon which I am about to embark
for a day, is one of the little French ships carrying
troops and war supplies, which for a month past
has been painfully and wearisomely going and
coming between the transports or freighters arriving
from France, and the port of Taku beyond the
Pei-Ho bar.</p>

<p>To-day it is full of Zouaves,&mdash;brave Zouaves
who arrived yesterday from Tunis, careless and
happy, bound for this ominous Chinese land.
They are crowded on the bridge, packed together,
their faces gay and their eyes wide open
for a glimpse of China, which has filled their
thoughts for weeks and which is now near at
hand, just over the horizon.</p>

<p>According to ceremonial custom, the <i>Bengali</i>,
when it appears, must pass the stern of the <i>Redoutable</i>
to salute the admiral. The music waits
behind the armor, ready to play one of those
marches so intoxicating to the sailor. And when
we come up close to the big ship, almost under
its shadow, all the Zouaves&mdash;those destined to
return as well as those who must perish&mdash;wave
their red caps to the sound of the bugle, with hurrahs
for the ship, which here represents France<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
to their eyes, and for the admiral, who from the
bridge raises his cap in their honor.</p>

<p>At the end of half an hour China appears.</p>

<p>Never has an uglier and more forbidding shore
surprised and congealed poor newly arrived soldiers.
A low shore, a gray barren land without
tree or grass. Everywhere there are forts of
colossal size of the same gray as the earth, masses
of geometrical outline pierced by embrasures for
guns. Never has the approach to a country presented
a more extensive or aggressive military
array; on both sides of the horrible stream with
its muddy waters loom similar forts, giving the
impression of a place both terrible and impregnable,
giving the impression also that this harbor,
in spite of its wretched surroundings, is of the first
order of importance, is the key to a great country,
and gives access to a city large, rich, and powerful&mdash;as
Pekin must have been. From a nearer view
the walls of the first two forts, stained, full of
holes, and ravaged by cannon-balls, bear witness
to furious and recent battles.</p>

<p>We know how, on the day Taku was taken,
they exhausted their strength on one another. By
a miracle, a French shell from the <i>Lion</i> fell right
into one of them, causing the explosion of its
enormous powder magazine so that the yellow
gunners lost their heads. The Japanese then
seized this fort and opened an unexpected fire on
the one opposite, and immediately the overthrow
of the Chinese began. Had it not been for this
chance, for this shell, and for this panic, all the
European gunners anchored in the Pei-Ho would
inevitably have been lost; the landing of the Allies
would have been impossible or problematical, and
the whole face of the war changed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<img src="images/i039.jpg" width="628" height="900" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Transports on the Pei-ho</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>We now move up the river through the muddy
infected water where impurities of all sorts are
floating, as well as the bodies of men and animals.
On both of the sombre shores we see by the light
of the declining sun a procession of ruins, a uniform
black and gray desolation of earth, ashes, and
calcined slopes, tumbled walls, and ruins.</p>

<p>On this pestilential river a feverish animation
reigns, so that it is difficult for us to make our
way through the obstructions. Junks by the hundreds,
each flying the colors and having at the
stern the name of the nation by whom it is employed&mdash;France,
Italy, United States, etc.&mdash;in
big letters above the devilry of the Chinese inscription,
besides a numberless flotilla of towing
vessels, lighters, colliers, and packets.</p>

<p>On the terrible, steep, muddy banks, amongst
filth and dead animals, there is an ant-like activity.
Soldiers of all the armies of Europe mingle with
coolies driven with sticks, unpacking military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
stores, tents, guns, wagons, mules, horses. Such
a confusion as never was of uniforms, rubbish,
cannons, débris, and provisions of all kinds. An
icy wind which rises toward evening makes us
shiver after the hot sun of the day and brings
with it the gloom of winter.</p>

<p>Before the ruins of a quarter where the flag
of France is floating, the <i>Bengali</i> approaches the
lugubrious shore, and our Zouaves disembark
rather discountenanced by the sombre reception
given them by China. While waiting for some
sort of a shelter to be provided, they light fires
on the shore which the wind fans into flame, and
there they heat their evening meal in darkness and
silence and in the midst of clouds of infected dust.</p>

<p>On the deserted plain from which the dust, the
cold, and the squalls come, the black devastated
town, overrun with soldiers, extends, breathing
pestilence and death.</p>

<p>A small street through its centre, hastily rebuilt
in a few days' time with mud, broken timbers, and
iron, is lined with dubious-looking taverns. Men
from I don't know where, mongrels of every race,
sell absinthe, salt-fish, and deadly liquors to the
soldiers. There is some drunkenness, and occasionally
knives are drawn.</p>

<p>Outside of this improvised quarter Taku no
longer exists. Nothing but ruined walls, burned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
roofs, piles of ashes, and nameless receptacles of
filth, wherein are huddled together old clothing,
dogs, and human heads covered with hair.</p>

<p>I slept on board the <i>Bengali</i>, this hospitality
having been extended to me by the commander.
Occasional shots break the nocturnal silence, and
toward morning I hear&mdash;although half asleep&mdash;horrible
cries uttered by the Chinese on shore.</p>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Friday</span>, October 12.<br />
</div>

<p>I rose at daybreak to go and take the train,
which still runs as far as Tien-Tsin and even a
little beyond. Farther on, the road having been
destroyed by Boxers, I shall continue I do not
yet know how, either in a Chinese cart, in a junk,
or on horseback, and from all accounts cannot
count on seeing the great walls of Pekin for six
or seven days. I have an order which will secure
me rations from the posts along the road, otherwise
I should run the risk of dying from hunger
in this ravaged land. I have as little baggage as
possible, nothing but a light canteen, and but one
travelling companion, a faithful servant brought
from France.</p>

<p>At the station, where I arrive at sunrise, I find
again all yesterday's Zouaves, their knapsacks on
their backs. No tickets are necessary for this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
railway, everything military is carried by right of
conquest. Along with Cossack and Japanese soldiers
a thousand Zouaves pile into carriages with
broken panes through which the wind whistles. I
find a place with their officers, and very soon we
are calling up memories of Africa, where they
have been, and longing for Tunis and Algeria the
White.</p>

<p>We are two hours and a half on the road
across the mournful plain. At first it was only
gray earth as at Taku; then there were reeds and
herbage touched with frost. On all sides are immense
splashes of red, like blood stains, due to
the autumn flowering of a kind of marsh plant.
On the horizon of this desert myriads of migratory
birds may be seen, rising like clouds, eddying
and then falling. The north wind blows and
it is very cold.</p>

<p>Soon the plain is peopled with tombs,&mdash;tombs
without number, all of the same shape,&mdash;each
one a kind of cone of earth piled up and surmounted
by a ball of faience,&mdash;some small, like
little huts, others as large as camping tents. They
are grouped according to families and they are
legion. The entire country is a burial-place with
a gory look resulting from the splashes of red to
which I have referred.</p>

<p>At the stopping-places where the ruined stations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
are occupied by Cossacks, there are calcined cars&mdash;damaged
by fire&mdash;and locomotives riddled with
balls. At other places we do not stop because
there is nothing left; the few villages which mark
this vicinity are all destroyed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Tien-Tsin! It is ten o'clock in the morning.
Pierced by the cold, we step down amid the clouds
of dust which the north wind perpetually scatters
over this dried-up country. We are taken in hand
by Chinese scouts, who, without even knowing
where we want to go, trot off, at full speed, with
us in their little carriages. The European streets
along which they are running (here called "concessions"),
seen through a cloud of blinding dust,
have the look of a big city, but the almost luxurious
houses are riddled with shells, literally ripped
open and without roofs or windows. The shores
of the rivers, here as at Taku, are like a fevered
babel; thousands of junks lie there, unloading
troops, horses, guns. In the streets where Chinese
workmen are carrying enormous loads of war
supplies, one meets soldiers of all the nations of
Europe, officers in every sort of uniform, on horseback,
in chairs, or on foot. And there is of course
a perpetual interchange of military salutes.</p>

<p>Where are we to lay our heads? Really, we
have no idea, in spite of our desire for a shelter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
from the icy wind and dust. However, our Chinese
runners keep on like rolling balls.</p>

<p>We knock at the doors of two or three hotels
which have risen up among the ruins out of a confusion
of broken furniture. Everything is full,
full to overflowing; gold will not buy a loft with
a mattress.</p>

<p>Willy-nilly we must beg our board and lodging
from unknown officers, who give us the most
friendly hospitality in houses where the holes
made by shot and shell have been hastily stopped
up so that the wind may no longer enter.</p>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Saturday</span>, October 13.<br />
</div>

<p>I have chosen to travel by junk as far as the
course of the Pei-Ho will permit, the junk serving
as a lodging in this country where I am forced to
dally.</p>

<p>This makes necessary many little preparations.</p>

<p>The first thing is to make a requisition for this
junk and to appropriate this species of sarcophagus
where I am to live under a roof of matting. The
next is to buy in the more or less ruined shops of
Tien-Tsin the things necessary for a few days of
nomadic life, from bedding to arms; and lastly, to
hire from the Lazarist Fathers a Chinese person to
make tea,&mdash;young Toum, aged fourteen, with the
face of a cat and a queue reaching to the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>I dined with General Frey, who, with his small
French detachment, was, as every one knows, the
first to enter the heart of Pekin, the Imperial City.
He was good enough to relate to me in detail this
magnificent journey, the taking of the Marble
Bridge and his final entrance into the Imperial
City,&mdash;that mysterious place which I shall soon
see, and into which before him no European had
ever penetrated.</p>

<p>As to my own small personal expedition, which
in comparison with his appears so easy and unimportant,
the general kindly concerned himself with
what we were to drink <i>en route</i>, my servant and I,
in this time of infection, when the water is a constant
danger on account of human remains, thrown
there by the Chinese, left lying in all the wells;
and he made me a present of untold value,&mdash;a
case of eau d'Evian.</p>


<h3>II<br />
THE TWO GODDESSES OF THE BOXERS
</h3>


<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Sunday</span>, October 14.<br />
</div>

<p>An old Chinese woman, wrinkled as a winter apple,
timidly opens the door at which we have loudly
knocked. It stands in the deep shadow of a narrow
passageway exhaling unhealthy fetid smells,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
between walls blackened by filth, where one feels
as shut in as in the heart of a prison.</p>

<p>The old woman, an enigmatical figure, looks us
all over with a blank impenetrable gaze; then recognizing
among us the chief of the international
police, she silently steps aside and permits us to
enter. We follow her into a dark little court.
Poor late autumn flowers are growing in the old
walls, and we breathe faint sickly odors.</p>

<p>We are a group of officers, three French, two
English, and one Russian, who are there clearly
by right of conquest.</p>

<p>Our conductor is a strange creature, balancing
on the tips of her incredibly small feet. Her gray
hair fastened with long pins is so tightly drawn
back that it seems to raise her eyes unduly. Her
dark dress is indefinite in color, but her parchment-like
face bears to a high degree that something
appertaining to a worn-out race, which we are
wont to call distinction. She appears to be only
a servant, yet her aspect, her carriage, are disconcerting;
some mystery broods over her, she seems
like a refined matron who has resorted to a shameful
clandestine occupation. This whole place,
moreover, is difficult to describe to those who do
not know it.</p>

<p>Beyond the court is a sordid vestibule, then a
door painted black, with a Chinese inscription<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
consisting of two big red letters. Without knocking,
the old woman draws the bolt and opens it.</p>

<p>We may be mistaken, but we have come in all
good faith to pay a visit to <i>two goddesses</i>,&mdash;prisoners
kept shut up in this palace. For here we
are in the common, the lower dependencies, the
secret places of the palace of the viceroy of Petchili,
and to reach this spot we have had to pass
over the immense desolation of a town with cyclopean
walls which is at present only a mass of
débris and dead bodies.</p>

<p>The animation of these ruins, accidentally
peopled by joyous soldiers, is singular, unique,
on this Sunday, which is a holiday in camp and
barracks. In the long streets filled with wreckage
of all kinds, Zouaves and African chasseurs, arm-in-arm
with Germans in pointed helmets, pass gaily
between the walls of roofless houses. There are
little Japanese soldiers, shining and automatic,
Russians with flat caps, plumed Bersaglieri, Austrians,
Americans with big felt hats, and Indian
cavalrymen with enormous turbans. All the flags
of Europe are floating over the ruins of Tien-Tsin,
which has been partitioned by the allied armies.
In certain quarters the Chinese who have gradually
returned, after their flight, have established bazars
in the open air in the lovely sunshine of this
autumn Sunday,&mdash;bazars where in the midst of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
incendiary ashes they sell to the soldiers articles
picked up in the ruins, porcelains, jars, silk dresses,
furs. There are so many of these soldiers, so many
uniforms of every kind on our route, so many
sentinels presenting arms, that we grow weary
returning the many salutes received as we pass
through this unheard-of babel.</p>

<p>At the farther side of the destroyed city, near
the high ramparts in front of the palace of the
viceroy, where we are going to see the goddesses,
some Chinese, undergoing torture in a kind of
pillory, are lined up along the wall, with inscriptions
above them describing their offences. Two
pickets guard the doors with bayonetted guns,
one an American, the other a Japanese, standing
alongside of the horrible grinning old stone monsters
who watch, crouching, on either side of the
entrance.</p>

<p>There is nothing sumptuous, nothing great in
this dusty, decrepit palace which we have traversed
unheeding, but it speaks of real China, of old
China, grimacing and hostile. There is a profusion
of monsters in marble, in broken faience, and
in worm-eaten wood, falling to pieces from sheer
old age or threatening from the edges of roofs to
do so; frightful forms half buried in sand and
ashes, with horns, claws, forked tongues, and big
squinting eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>In the grim walled court a few late roses are
still in blossom under trees a century old.</p>

<p>Now, after various turns along badly lighted
passages, we reach the goddesses' door,&mdash;the one
marked with two big red letters. The old Chinese
woman, ever mute and mysterious, with head held
high but with lifeless eyes persistently downcast,
pushes open the black doors, with a gesture of
submission which means: "Here they are, look
at them!"</p>

<p>In a room which is almost dark and where the
evening sun never enters, two poor girls, two sisters
who look alike, are seated with bowed heads
amid lamentable disorder, in positions indicative
of supreme consternation,&mdash;one on a chair, the
other on the edge of an ebony bed which they must
share at night. They are dressed in humble black,
but here and there on the floor are scattered shining
silks and tunics embroidered in big flowers
and gold chimæras,&mdash;the garments they put on
when going to meet the armies, in the midst of
whistling bullets on days of battle,&mdash;their attire
as warriors and goddesses.</p>

<p>For they are a kind of Jeanne d'Arc,&mdash;if it is
not blasphemy to pronounce a name of almost
ideal purity in this connection,&mdash;they are the goddesses
of the incomprehensible Boxers, so atrocious
and at the same time so admirable: hysterical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
creatures, exciting both the hatred and terror of
the foreigner, who one day fled without fighting
in a panic of fear, and the next with the shrieks
of the possessed threw themselves straight into
the face of death, under a shower of bullets from
troops ten times as numerous as themselves.</p>

<p>The goddesses, taken prisoners, are the property,
the curious bibelot, if one may use the word, of
the seven Allies. They are not badly treated.
They are merely shut up for fear they will commit
suicide, which has become a fixed idea with them.
What will be their fate? Already their captors
are tired of seeing them and don't know what to
do with them.</p>

<p>On a day of defeat the junk in which they
sought refuge was surrounded, and they, with
their mother, who followed them everywhere,
threw themselves into the water. The soldiers
fished them out fainting. The goddesses after
much care came to their senses. But the mamma
never again opened her oblique old Chinese eyes.
The girls were made to believe that she had been
taken to a hospital and would soon come back.
At first the prisoners were brave, animated,
haughty, and always well dressed. But this very
morning they have been told that their mother is
no more, and it is that which has stunned them,
like a physical blow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Having no money to buy mourning dress, which
in China is always white, they asked to be allowed
white leather shoes&mdash;which at this moment cover
their doll-like feet, and which are as essential here
as the crape veil is with us.</p>

<p>They are both slender and of a waxen pallor,
scarcely pretty, but with a certain grace, a certain
charm as they stand there, one in front of the
other, without tears, with drooping eyes and with
arms falling straight at their sides. They do not
raise their eyes even to ascertain who enters or
what is wanted of them. They do not stir as we
come in, nothing matters to them now. They
await death, indifferent to everything.</p>

<p>They inspire in us an unlooked-for respect by
the dignity of their despair, respect and infinite
compassion. We have nothing to say to one another,
and are as embarrassed at being there as
though we had been guilty of some indiscretion.</p>

<p>It occurred to us to put some money on the
disordered bed; but one of the sisters, while appearing
not to see us, threw the pieces of silver
onto the floor and with a gesture invited the servant
to dispose of them as she wished. So that
this was on our part a further mistake.</p>

<p>There is such an abyss of misunderstanding
between European officers and Boxer goddesses
that it is impossible to show our sympathy for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
them in any way. So we, who came to be amused
by a curious sight, depart in silence with a tightening
of the heartstrings at the thought of the
two poor creatures imprisoned in a gloomy room
in the fading evening light.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>My junk, with five Chinese aboard, will go up
the river under the French flag, which is already
a protection. The war department has decided it
to be more prudent&mdash;although my servant and
I are armed&mdash;to send two soldiers with us, two
men with horses carrying guns and munitions.</p>

<p>Beyond Tien-Tsin, where I have spent another
day, one may go an hour further by train in the
direction of Pekin, as far as the town of Yang-Soon.
My junk, with two soldiers, Toum, and
the baggage, will await me there at a bend in the
river, and has gone on ahead to-day with a
military escort.</p>

<p>I dine this evening with the consul-general, the
one who escaped being shot almost by miracle,
although his flag was for a long time, during the
siege, a mark for the Chinese gunners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>


<h3>III</h3>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Monday</span>, October 15.<br />
</div>

<p>I left Tien-Tsin by railway at eight o'clock in
the morning. An hour on the road, across the
same old plain, the same desolation, the same
cutting wind, the same dust. Then the ruins of
Yang-Soon, where the train stops because there
is no road left; from this point on, the Boxers
have destroyed everything, the bridges are cut,
the stations burned, and the rails scattered over
the country.</p>

<p>My junk is there awaiting me by the river's
side. For the present, for three days at least,
I must arrange for a life on the water, in the little
sarcophagus which is the cabin of this queer boat,
under the roof of matting which gives a view of
the sky through a thousand holes, and which to-night
will permit the white frost to disturb our
slumbers. But this room in which I am to live,
eat and sleep in complete promiscuity with my
French companions is so small, so very small that
I dismiss one of the soldiers. We could never
manage there with four.</p>

<p>The Chinese of my train, ragged and sordid,
receive me with profound bows. One takes the
rudder, the others jump onto the bank, where they
harness themselves to the end of a long line attached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
to the mast of the junk&mdash;and we are off,
being towed against the current of the Pei-Ho, a
heavy poisonous stream in which, here and there
amongst the reeds on the banks, parts of human
bodies appear.</p>

<p>The soldier I have kept is named Renaud, and
he tells me he comes from Calvados. He and my
servant Osman, both happy to be going to Pekin,
vie with one another in gaiety and good-will and
in comical ingenious inventions to make our lodging
more convenient. The trip, in spite of
unpleasant surroundings, begins to the sound of
their merry childlike laughter. We depart in the
full morning light, under the rays of a deceptive
sunshine which pretends it is summer although
an icy wind is blowing.</p>

<p>The seven allied nations have established military
posts from point to point along the Pei-Ho,
to insure communication by way of the river
between Pekin and the gulf of Petchili, where
their ships come in. Toward eleven o'clock I stop
the junk near a large Chinese fort from which
floats the French flag.</p>

<p>It is one of our posts occupied by Zouaves; we
get out to get our rations, enough bread, wine,
preserves, sugar, and tea for two days. We shall
receive no more now until Tong-Tchow (City of
Celestial Purity), which we shall reach day after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
to-morrow in the evening, if nothing untoward
prevents. Then the towing of our junk begins
again; slowly and monotonously we move between
gloomy devastated banks.</p>

<p>The country around us remains unchanged.
On both sides as far as the eye can reach are
fields of "sorghos"&mdash;which is a kind of giant
millet much taller than our maize. The war prevented
its being harvested in season, and so it
stands reddened by the frost. The monotonous
little tow-path, a narrow strip on the grayish soil,
is on a level with the cold fetid water, at the foot
of the eternal dried sorghos, which forms an endless
curtain all along the river. Sometimes a
phantom village appears on the horizon; as one
approaches it, it proves to be only ruins and the
bodies of the dead.</p>

<p>I have a mandarin's arm-chair in my junk on
which to enthrone myself when the sun shines and
the wind is not too cutting. More frequently I
prefer to walk along the shore doing my miles in
company with our towers, who plod along bending
over like beasts of burden, with the rope passed
over the shoulders. Osman and Renaud peer out
of a port-hole after me as we walk along the
track of gray earth shut in by the uninterrupted
border of sorghos and by the river, the wind blowing
sharply all the while. We are often obliged to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
step aside suddenly because of a dead man&mdash;with
one leg stretched out across the path&mdash;looking
slyly up at us.</p>

<p>The events of the day are the meeting of junks
going down the river and passing ours. They go
in long lines fastened together, flying the flag of
some one of the allied nations, and carrying the
sick, the wounded, and the spoils of war.</p>

<p>In the twilight we pass the remains of a village
in which the Russians, on their way to Manchuria,
are encamped for the night. They are taking
carved furniture out of an abandoned house,
breaking it up and making a fire of it. As we go
on we see the flames mounting in great jets, and
reaching out to the sorghos near by; for a long
time its incendiary light is visible behind us, in the
mournful empty grayness of the distance. This
first nightfall on our junk is full of gloom in the
strange solitude into which hour by hour we penetrate
still further. The shadows are deep about
us and there are many dead along the ground. In
the confused and infinite darkness, all about us
seems hostile or gloomy, and the cold increases
with the silence and obscurity.</p>

<p>The impression of melancholy disappears at
supper when our Chinese lantern is lighted, illuminating
the sarcophagus, which we have closed as
tightly as possible to shut out the wind. I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
invited my two companions to my table&mdash;my
comical little table, which they themselves have
made from a broken oar and an old plank. The
bread seems exquisite to us after our long walk
on the bank; to warm us we have the hot tea
which young Toum has prepared for us over a
fire of sorghos, and when hunger is assuaged and
Turkish cigarettes give forth their soothing clouds
of smoke, we have almost a feeling of home and
comfort in our poor shelter enveloped in outside
darkness.</p>

<p>Then comes bedtime&mdash;although the junk moves
on, our towers continuing their march by feeling
their way along the sorghos of the dark path, so
full of surprises. Toum, although he is an elegant
young Chinaman, goes to roost with the others
of his race in the straw in the hold. The rest of us,
still dressed of course, with our boots on and firearms
at hand, stretch out on the narrow camp-bed
of our cabin, looking at the stars, which, as soon
as the lantern is out, appear between the meshes
of our matting-roof, shining brightly in the frosty
sky.</p>

<p>Distant shots reach us from far off, indicating
nocturnal dramas with which we have no concern,
and just before midnight two guards, one Japanese
and the other German, try to stop our junk;
we are obliged to get up to discuss the matter, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
by means of a hastily lighted lantern, show the
French flag and the stripes that I wear on my
sleeve.</p>

<p>At midnight the Chinese make fast our boat, at
a spot they say is safe, so that they too may rest.
We all fall into a profound slumber in the icy
night.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Tuesday</span>, October 16.<br />
</div>

<p>We are up at daylight and off again. In the cold,
magnificent dawn, upon a clear pink sky, the sun
rises and shines without heat on the green plain,
and on the deserted place where we have slept.</p>

<p>All at once I leap to the ground with an instinctive
longing for activity, anxious to move, to walk.
Horrors! At a turn in the path as I am running
fast without looking where I am going, I almost
step on something in the form of a cross,&mdash;a
naked corpse lying face downward with extended
arms, half buried in the mud and of a corresponding
color; the dogs or the crows, or some Chinese
who wanted the queue, have taken the scalp,
leaving the cranium white and minus hair or skin.</p>

<p>It grows colder each day as we get farther away
from the sea, and the plain begins gradually to
slope upward.</p>

<p>Junks pass as they did yesterday, going down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the river in files with military stores, and are under
the care of soldiers of all the nations of Europe.
Then come long intervals of solitude, during which
no living thing appears in this region of millet and
reeds. The wind that blows more and more bitterly
is healthful; it dilates the chest, and for the
moment redoubles life. So we march along between
the sorghos and the river, on the everlasting
frosty path that leads to Pekin, without fatigue,
without any desire to hurry, but always ahead of
the solemn Chinamen, who, tugging at their ropes,
continue to draw our floating house, keeping up
their pace with the regularity of machines.</p>

<p>There are a few trees now on the banks, willows
with very green leaves of a variety unknown to us;
they seem untouched by the autumn, and their
beautiful color is in striking contrast to the rusty
tones of the grass and the dying sorghos. There
are gardens too,&mdash;abandoned gardens that belonged
to hamlets that have been burned; our
Chinamen sometimes send one of their number on
a marauding expedition, and he brings back armfuls
of vegetables for our meals.</p>

<p>Osman and Renaud, as we pass by ruined
houses, sometimes pick up articles which they
think necessary for the embellishment of our
dwelling,&mdash;small mirrors, carved seats, lanterns,
even bunches of artificial flowers made of rice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
paper, which may have adorned the headdresses
of massacred or fleeing Chinese ladies, and which
they naïvely use to decorate the walls of the room.
The interior of our sarcophagus soon takes on an
air of distinction quite droll and barbaric.</p>

<p>It is astonishing how soon we accustom ourselves
to the perfectly simple life on the junk, an
existence of healthy fatigue, devouring appetites,
and heavy sleep.</p>

<p>Toward the evening of this day the mountains
of Mongolia, those which tower above Pekin,
begin to appear on the distant horizon, on the very
border of this infinitely level land.</p>

<p>There is something especially lugubrious about
the twilight to-day. The sinuous Pei-Ho, narrowing
hour by hour at each turn, seems to be but a
tiny stream between its silent shores, and we feel
altogether too much shut in by the confused
growth which conceals such sombre things. The
day goes out in one of those cold dead colorings
that are a specialty of Northern winters. All that
there is in the way of light comes from the water,
which reflects more vividly than the sky; the
river, like a mirror, reflects the sunset yellows; one
might even say that it exaggerates the sad light, as
it runs between the inverted images of the reeds,
the monotonous sorghos and the already black
silhouettes of the few trees. The solitude is deeper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
than that of yesterday. The cold and the silence
settle down upon one like a winding sheet. There
is a penetrating melancholy in feeling the slow
oncoming of the night in this nameless spot, a
certain anguish in looking at the last reflections of
the neighboring reeds,&mdash;reflections which continue,
even though ahead of us darkness claims the
hostile and unknown distance.</p>

<p>Happily, the hour for supper is here, the longed-for
hour, for we are very hungry. In our little
retreat I shall find again the red light of our lantern,
the excellent soldier's bread, the smoking tea
served by Toum, and the cheerfulness of my two
good servants.</p>

<p>Toward nine o'clock, just as we pass a group
of junks full of people, all Chinese,&mdash;marauders'
junks evidently,&mdash;we hear cries behind us,&mdash;cries
of distress and death, cries that are horrible
in the stillness. Toum, who lends his fine ear and
understands all that these people are saying, explains
that they are engaged in killing an old man
because he has stolen some rice. We were not
numerous enough or sure enough of our party, to
interfere. I fired two shots into the air in their
direction, and all became still as if by magic; we
had, no doubt, saved the head of the old rice thief
at least until the morning.</p>

<p>Then it is quiet until daylight. After midnight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
tied up no matter where among the reeds, we all
sleep a sleep that is undisturbed. It is calm and
cold under the stars. There are a few shots fired
in the distance. We are conscious of them, but
they do not wake us.</p>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Wednesday</span>, October 17.<br />
</div>

<p>We rise at daybreak and run along the bank in
the white frost; the dawn is pink, and soon the
sun rises bright and clear.</p>

<p>Wishing to take a short cut through the everlasting
sorghos fields and to rejoin the junk which
is obliged to follow a long turn in the river further
on, we cross the ruins of a hamlet where frightfully
contorted bodies are lying, on whose blackened
members the ice has formed little crystals
that shine like a coating of salt.</p>

<p>After our noon dinner, as we emerge from the
semi-obscurity of our sarcophagus, the Chinamen
point to the horizon. Tong-Tchow, the "City
of Celestial Purity," is beginning to show itself;
great black walls surmounted with miradors, and
an astonishingly tall, slender tower, of a very
Chinese outline with twenty superimposed roofs.</p>

<p>It is all distant still, and the plains about us are
full of horrors. From a stranded junk emerges a
long dead arm, of a bluish tone. And the bodies
of cattle borne by the current pass by us in a perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
procession, all swollen and exhaling a bovine
pest. A cemetery must have been violated hereabouts,
for on the mud of the shore there are
empty coffins with human bones alongside them.</p>


<h3>V<br />
AT TONG-TCHOW</h3>

<p>Tong-Tchow, which occupies two or three kilometres
along the bank, is one of those immense
Chinese cities&mdash;more densely populated than many
of the capitals of Europe&mdash;whose very name is
almost unheard of with us. To-day, needless to
say, it is but the ghost of a city, and as one approaches
it it does not take long to perceive that it
is now empty and in ruin.</p>

<p>We approach slowly. At the foot of the high
black crenellated walls, junks are crowded all along
the river. On the bank the same excitement as at
Taku and at Tien-Tsin is complicated by some
hundreds of Mongolian camels crouching in the
dust.</p>

<p>There are soldiers, invaders, cannons, materials
of war. Cossacks who are trying captured horses
go and come at full gallop among the various
groups, with great savage cries.</p>

<p>The various national colors of the European<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Allies are hoisted in profusion; they float from
high up on the black walls pierced by cannon balls,
from the camps, from the junks, from the ruins.
And the continual wind&mdash;the implacable icy wind
carrying the infected dust that smells of the dead&mdash;plays
upon these flags, which give an ironical
air of festivity to all the devastation.</p>

<p>I look for the French flags so as to stop my
junk in our neighborhood and to go at once to
our quarters. I can try our country's rations there
this evening; furthermore, not being able to continue
our trip on the river, I must procure for to-morrow
morning a cart and some saddle horses.</p>

<p>Stopping near a place which seems to belong to
us, I ask some Zouaves the road to our quarters;
they promptly, eagerly, and politely offer to accompany
me. Together we go on toward a great door
in the thick black wall.</p>

<p>At this entrance to the city they have, by means
of ropes and boards, established a cattle-yard for
the purpose of supplying food for the soldiers.
Besides a few live animals there are three or four
on the ground, dead from the bovine pest, and
some Chinese prisoners have this moment come
to drag them to the river, the general rendezvous
for dead bodies.</p>

<p>We enter a street where our soldiers are employed
at various kinds of work in the midst of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
heaps of rubbish. Through the broken doors and
windows of the houses the wretched interiors are
visible; everything is in fragments, broken, destroyed
as though for pleasure. From the thick
dust raised by the north wind and by our own
footsteps rises an intolerable odor of the dead.</p>

<p>For two months the rage for destruction, the
frenzy for murder, has beset this unfortunate
"City of Celestial Purity," invaded by the troops
of eight or ten different countries. She felt the
first shock of all these hereditary hatreds. First
the Boxers came her way. Then the Japanese,&mdash;heroic
little soldiers of whom I do not wish to
speak ill, but who destroy and kill as barbarian
armies were wont to do. Still less do I wish to
speak ill of our friends, the Russians; but they
have sent here their Cossack neighbors from Tartary,
and half-Mongolian Siberians, all admirable
under fire, but looking at war in the Asiatic
fashion. Then there are the cruel cavalrymen of
India sent by Great Britain. America has let
loose her soldiers. And when, in the first desire
for vengeance for Chinese cruelties, the Italians,
the Germans, the Austrians, and the French arrived,
nothing was left intact.</p>

<p>Our commander and his officers have improvised
lodgings and offices in some of the larger
Chinese houses, hastily repairing the roofs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
walls. In strong contrast to the rudeness of these
places are the sumptuous wood carvings and the
tall Chinese vases found intact among the ruins.</p>

<p>They promise me carriages and horses for to-morrow
morning to be ready at sunrise on the
bank near my junk. When all is settled there is
about an hour of daylight left, so I wander about
the ruins of the city with my armed followers,
Osman, Renaud, and Chinese Toum.</p>

<p>As one gets farther away from the quarters
where our soldiers are, the horrors increase with
the solitude and the silence.</p>

<p>We come first to the street of the China merchants,
great warehouses where the products of
the Canton manufactories were stored. It must
have been a fine street judging from the carved
and gilded but ruined façades which remain.
To-day the yawning shops, almost demolished,
seem to vomit onto the highway their heaps of
broken fragments. One walks on precious enamel
decorated with brilliant flowers, for it literally
covers the ground so that one crushes it in passing.
There is no knowing whose work this was;
it was already done when our troops arrived. But
it must have taken whole days of furious attack
with boots and clubs to reduce it all to such small
bits; jars, plates, cups, are ground to atoms, pulverized,
together with human bones and hair. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the back of these warehouses the coarser wares
occupied a sort of interior court. These courts
with their old walls are particularly lugubrious
this evening, in the dying light. In one of them
we found a mangy dog trying to drag something
from underneath a pile of broken plates&mdash;it was
the body of a child whose skull had been broken.
The dog began to eat the flesh that was left on the
legs of the poor dead thing.</p>

<p>There was no one to be seen in the long devastated
streets where the framework of the houses,
as well as the tiles and the bricks, had tumbled
down. Crows croaked in the silence. Horrible
dogs who feed on the dead fled before us, hanging
their tails. We had glimpses of Chinese prowlers,
wretched-looking creatures, trying to find something
to steal, or of some of the dispossessed
timidly creeping along the walls attempting to
find out what has become of their homes.</p>

<p>The sun is already low, and the wind is rising
as it does every night. We shiver with the sudden
cold. Empty houses fill the shadows.</p>

<p>These houses are all of considerable extent, with
recesses, a succession of courts, rock work, basins,
and melancholy gardens. Crossing the threshold,
guarded by the ever-present granite monsters worn
by the rubbing of hands, one finds oneself in an
endless series of apartments. The intimate details<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of Chinese life are touchingly and graciously revealed
by the arrangement of potted plants, flowerbeds,
and little balconies where bindweed and other
vines are trained.</p>

<p>Here, surrounded with playthings, is a poor
doll, which doubtless belonged to some child
whose head has been broken; there a cage hangs
with the bird still in it, dried up in one corner
with its feet in the air.</p>

<p>Everything is sacked, removed, or destroyed;
furniture is broken, the contents of drawers
thrown about the floors, papers, blood-stained
clothing, Chinese women's shoes spattered with
blood, and here and there limbs, hands, heads,
and clumps of hair.</p>

<p>In certain of the gardens neglected plants
continue to blossom gaily, running over into the
walks amongst the human remains. Around an
arbor which conceals the body of a woman, twines
pink convolvulus in blossoming garlands. The
blossom is still open at this late hour of the day
and in spite of the cold nights, which quite upsets
our European ideas of convolvulus.</p>

<p>In one of the houses back in a recess in a dark
loft, something moves! Two women cower pitifully!
Finding themselves discovered, they are
seized with terror and fall at our feet, trembling,
weeping, clasping their hands, and begging for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
mercy. One is young, the other older, and they
look alike. Mother and daughter! "Pardon, sir,
pardon; we are afraid," translates little Toum
naïvely, understanding their broken words. Evidently
they expect the worst of us&mdash;and then
death. For how long have they lived in this hole,
these two poor things, thinking with each step that
resounds on the pavement of the deserted court that
their end has come? We leave them a few pieces
of silver, which perhaps humiliates without helping
them, but it is all that we can do, and then we go.</p>

<p>Another house, a house of the rich this one is,
with a profusion of potted plants in enamelled
porcelain jars in the sad little garden. In an
apartment that is already dark (for decidedly
night is coming on, the uncertainty of twilight is
beginning), but where the havoc is less extensive,
for there are great chests and beautiful arm-chairs
still intact, Osman suddenly recoils with
terror before something which emerges from a
bucket placed upon a board. Two torn thighs,
the whole lower part of a woman thrust into this
bucket with the feet in the air! Undoubtedly the
mistress of this elegant home. Her body? Who
knows what has been done with the body? But
here is the head, under this arm-chair, near the
skeleton of a cat. The mouth is open, showing
the teeth, and the hair is long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>In addition to the broad, almost straight streets
whose desolation is visible from one end to the
other, there are little tortuous streets leading up
to gray walls. They are the most desolate to enter
at this twilight hour, with only the cry of the crow
as an accompaniment. Little stone gnomes guard
their mysterious doors, and their pavements are
strewn with human heads with long queues. One
approaches certain turns in the streets with a heavy
heart. It is over, and nothing in the world would
tempt us to enter again at this hour one of those
frightfully still houses where one meets with so
many gruesome encounters.</p>

<p>We had gone far into the city before night
came on, and the silence had become intolerable.
We return to the region where the troops
are quartered, cut by the north wind and chilled
by the cold and gloom; our return is rapid;
broken china and other débris impossible to define
crackle under our feet.</p>

<p>The banks are lined with soldiers warming
themselves and cooking their suppers over bright
fires, where they are burning chairs, tables, and
bits of carved wood or timbers. Coming out of
the Dantesque streets, it all bespeaks joy and comfort
to us.</p>

<p>Near our junk there is a canteen, improvised by
a Maltese, where intoxicants are sold to soldiers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
I send my men to get whatever liquors they want
for our supper, for we need something to warm
and cheer us if possible. We celebrate with smoking
soup, tea, chartreuse, and I don't know what
besides, in our little matting-covered dwelling,
tied up this time on the pestilential mud and enveloped
as usual by cold and darkness.</p>

<p>At dessert, when the hour for smoking arrives
in our sarcophagus, Renaud, to whom I have given
the floor, tells us that his squadron is encamped on
the borders of a Chinese cemetery in Tien-Tsin,
and that the soldiers of another European nation
(I prefer not to say which) in the same vicinity
spend their time ransacking the graves and taking
from them the money which it is the custom to
bury with the dead.</p>

<p>"To me, colonel" (I am colonel to him, as he
is ignorant of the naval appellation of <i>commandant</i>,
which, with us, goes with five gold stripes),
"to me it does not seem right. Even though they
are Chinese, we ought to leave their dead in peace.
What disgusts me is that they cut their rations up
on the planks of the coffins. And I say to them,
'Put it on the outside if you will, but not on the
inside, which has touched the corpse.' But these
savages, colonel, laugh at me."</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Thursday</span>, October 18.<br />
</div>

<p>It is a surprise to awaken to a dark and sombre
sky. We counted upon having, as on the preceding
mornings, the almost never clouded autumn and
winter sun, which in China shines and warms even
when everything is frozen hard, and which has,
up to this time, helped us to support the gruesome
sights of our journey.</p>

<p>When we open the door of the junk just before
dawn, our horses and cart are there, having just
arrived. On the forbidding shore some Mongolians
with their camels are crouched about a fire
which has burned all night in the dust; and behind
their motionless groups the high walls of the city,
of an inky blackness, rise to meet the low-hanging
clouds.</p>

<p>We leave our small nomadic equipment in the
junk, in the care of two marines of the Tong-Tchow
division, who will look after it until our
return, and also our most precious possession, the
last of the bottles of pure water given us by the
general.</p>

<p>The last stage of our journey is made in the
company of the French consul-general at Tien-Tsin
and of the chancellor of the legation, who are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
both bound for Pekin, under the escort of a
marshal and three or four artillerymen.</p>

<p>Our long, monotonous route leads us across
fields of sorghos reddened by the early frosts, and
through deserted villages where no one is stirring.
It is a cold, gray morning, and the autumn country,
upon which a fine rain is falling, is in mourning.</p>

<p>At certain moments I almost fancy myself on
the roads of the Basque country in November,
amid the uncut maize. Then all at once some
unknown symbol arises to recall China,&mdash;either
a tomb of mysterious shape or a stele mounted
upon enormous granite tortoises.</p>

<p>From time to time we meet military convoys of
one nation or another, or lines of ambulances. In
one place some Russians have taken shelter from
a shower in the ruins of a village; in another a
number of Americans, who have discovered some
hidden clothing in an abandoned house, go on their
way rejoicing, with fur mantles on their backs.</p>

<p>Then there are tombs, always tombs, from one
end to the other; China is strewn with them;
some are almost hidden by the roadside, others are
magnificently isolated in enclosures which are like
mortuary thickets of dark green cedars.</p>

<p>Ten o'clock. We should be approaching Pekin,
although as yet nothing indicates its nearness.
We have not seen a single Chinese since our departure;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the whole country is deserted and silent
under a veil of almost imperceptible rain.</p>

<p>We are going to pass not far from the tomb of
an empress, it seems, and the French chancellor,
who knows the neighborhood, proposes that he and
I make a détour to look at it. So, leaving the
others to continue their route, we take a side path
through the tall, damp grass.</p>

<p>A canal and a pool soon appear, of a pale color,
under the indefinite sky. There is no one to be
seen anywhere; the sad quiet of a depopulated
country prevails. The tomb on the opposite bank
scarcely peeps out from its cedar wood, which is
walled about on all sides. We see little but the
first marble gates leading to it and the avenue of
white stele which is finally lost under the mysterious
trees. It is all rather distant, and is reproduced
in the mirror of the pool in long inverted
reflections. Near us the tall leaden stems of
some lotus killed by the frost bend over the water,
where the rain drops have traced faint rings. The
whitish spheres seen here and there are heads of
the dead.</p>

<p>When we rejoin our company they promise that
we shall enter Pekin in half an hour. After the
complications and delays of our journey we almost
believe we shall never arrive. Besides, it is incredible
that so large a city could be so near in
this deserted country, such a little way ahead
of us.</p>

<span class="smcap">The Great Wall surrounding the Outer City of Pekin</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>"Pekin does not proclaim itself," explains my
new companion. "Pekin takes hold of you; when
you perceive it you are there."</p>

<p>The road passes through groups of cedars and
willows with falling leaves, and in the concentration
of our effort to see the City Celestial we
trot on in the fine rain, which does not wet us at
all, so drying are the northern winds, carrying the
dust always and everywhere; we trot on without
speaking.</p>

<p>"Pekin!" suddenly exclaims one of our companions,
pointing out an obscure mass just rising
above the trees,&mdash;a crenellated dungeon of superhuman
proportions.</p>

<p>Pekin! In a few seconds, during which I am
feeling the spell of this name, a big gloomy wall,
of unheard-of height, is disclosed, and goes on
endlessly in the gray, empty solitude, which resembles
an accursed steppe. It is like a complete
change of scene, performed without the noise of
machinery or the sounds of an orchestra, in a
silence more impressive than any music. We are
at the very foot of the bastions and ramparts,
dominated by them, although a turn in the road
had up to this moment concealed them. At the
same time the rain is turning to snow, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
white flakes mingle with the suspended dirt and
dust. The wall of Pekin overwhelms us, a giant
thing of Babylonian aspect, intensely black under
the dead light of a snowy autumn morning. It
rises toward the sky like a cathedral, but it goes
on; it is prolonged, always the same, for miles.
Not a person on the outskirts of the city, not a
green thing all along these walls! The ground
is uneven, dusty, ashen in color, and strewn with
rags, bones, and even an occasional skull! From
the top of each black battlement a crow salutes us
as we pass, cawing mournfully.</p>

<p>The clouds are so thick and low that we do not
see clearly; we are oppressed by long-looked-for
Pekin, which has just made its abrupt and disconcerting
appearance above our heads; we advance
to the intermittent cries of the crows, rather silent
ourselves, overpowered at being there, longing to
see some movement, some life, some one or some
thing come out from these walls.</p>

<p>From a gate ahead of us, from a hole in the
colossal enclosure, slowly emerges an enormous
brown, woolly animal like a gigantic sheep; then
two, then three, then ten. A Mongolian caravan
begins to pass us, always in the same silence,
broken only by the croakings of the ravens.
These enormous Mongolian camels, with their
furry coats, muffs on their legs, and manes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
like lions, file in an endless procession past our
frightened horses. They wear neither bells nor
rattles, like the thin beasts of the Arabian deserts;
their feet sink deep into the sand, which muffles
their footsteps so the silence is not broken by their
march.</p>

<p>Perceived through a veil of fine snow and black
dust, the caravan has passed us, and moves on
without a sound, like a phantom thing. We find
ourselves alone again, under this Titanic wall,
from which the crows keep watch. And now it is
our turn to enter the gloomy city through the
gates by which the Mongolians have just passed
out.</p>


<h3>VII<br />
AT THE FRENCH LEGATION</h3>


<p>Here we are at the gates, the double triple gates,
deep as tunnels, and formed of the most powerful
masonry,&mdash;gates surmounted by deadly dungeons,
each one five stories high, with strange
curved roofs,&mdash;extravagant dungeons, colossal
black things above a black enclosing wall.</p>

<p>Our horses' hoofs sink deeper and deeper, disappear,
in fact, in the coal-black dust, which is
blinding and all-pervading, in the atmosphere
as well as on the ground, in spite of the light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
rain and the snowflakes which make our faces
tingle.</p>

<p>Noiselessly, as though we were stepping upon
wadding or felt, we pass under the enormous vaults
and enter the land of ruin and ashes.</p>

<p>A few slatternly beggars shivering in corners
in their blue rags, a few corpse-eating dogs, like
those whose acquaintance we have already made
<i>en route</i>,&mdash;and that is all. Silence and solitude
within as well as without these walls. Nothing
but rubbish and ruin, ruin.</p>

<p>The land of rubbish and ashes, and little gray
bricks,&mdash;little bricks all alike, scattered in countless
myriads upon the sites of houses that have
been destroyed, or upon the pavement of what once
were streets.</p>

<p>Little gray bricks,&mdash;this is the sole material of
which Pekin was built; a city of small, low houses
decorated with a lacework of gilded wood; a city
of which only a mass of curious débris is left,
after fire and shell have crumbled away its flimsy
materials.</p>

<p>We have come into the city at one of the corners
where there was the fiercest fighting,&mdash;the Tartar
quarter, which contained the European legations.</p>

<p>Long straight streets may still be traced in this
infinite labyrinth of ruins; ahead of us all is gray
or black; to the sombre gray of the fallen brick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
is added the monotonous tone which follows a
fire,&mdash;the gloom of ashes and the gloom of coal.</p>

<p>Sometimes in crossing the road they form obstacles,&mdash;these
tiresome little bricks; these are
the remains of barricades where fighting must have
taken place.</p>

<p>After a few hundred metres we enter the street
of the legations, upon which for so many months
the anxious attention of the whole world was fixed.</p>

<p>Everything is in ruins, of course; yet European
flags float on every piece of wall, and we suddenly
find, as we come out of the smaller streets, the
same animation as at Tien-Tsin,&mdash;a continual
coming and going of officers and soldiers, and an
astonishing array of uniforms.</p>

<p>A big flag marks the entrance to what was our
legation, two monsters in white marble crouch at
the threshold; this is the etiquette for all Chinese
palaces. Two of our soldiers guard the door which
I enter, my thoughts recurring to the heroes who
defended it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We finally dismount, amid piles of rubbish, in an
inner square near a chapel, and at the entrance to
a garden where the trees are losing their leaves as
an effect of the icy winds. The walls about us are
so pierced with balls that they look like sieves.
The pile of rubbish at our right is the legation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
proper, destroyed by the explosion of a Chinese
mine. At our left is the chancellor's house, where
the brave defenders of the place took refuge during
the siege, because it was in a less exposed situation.
They have offered to take me in there; it
was not destroyed, but everything is topsy-turvy,
as though it were the day after a battle; and in
the room where I am to sleep the plasterers are at
work repairing the walls, which will not be finished
until this evening.</p>

<p>As a new arrival, I am taken on a pilgrimage to
the garden where those of our sailors who fell on
the field of honor were hastily buried amid a
shower of balls. There is no grass here, no blossoming
plants, only a gray soil trampled by the
combatants,&mdash;crumbling from dryness and cold,&mdash;trees
without leaves and with branches broken
by shot, and over all a gloomy, lowering sky, with
snowflakes that are cutting.</p>

<p>We remove our hats as we enter this garden,
for we know not upon whose remains we may be
treading. The graves will soon be marked, I doubt
not, but have not yet been, so one is not sure as
one walks of not having under foot some one of
the dead who merits a crown.</p>

<p>In this house of the chancellor, spared as by a
miracle, the besieged lived helter-skelter, slept on
a floor space the size of which was day by day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
decreased by the damage done by shot and shell,
and were in imminent danger of death.</p>

<p>In the beginning&mdash;their number, alas, rapidly
diminished&mdash;there were sixty French sailors and
twenty Austrians, meeting death, side by side, with
equally magnificent courage. To them were added
a few French volunteers, who took their turns on
the barricades or on the roofs, and two foreigners,
M. and Madame Rosthorn of the Austrian legation.
Our officers in command of the defence
were Lieutenant Darcy and midshipman Herber;
the latter was struck full in the face by a ball, and
sleeps to-day in the garden.</p>

<p>The horrible part of this siege was that no pity
was to be expected from the besiegers, if, starved,
and at the end of their strength, it became necessary
for the besieged to surrender, it was death,
and death with atrocious Chinese refinements to
prolong the paroxysms of suffering.</p>

<p>Neither was there the hope of escape by some
supreme sortie; they were in the midst of a
swarming city, they were enclosed in a labyrinth
of buildings that sheltered a crowd of enemies,
and were still further imprisoned by the feeling
that, surrounding them, walling in the whole, was
the colossal black rampart of Pekin.</p>

<p>It was during the torrid period of the Chinese
summer; it was often necessary to fight while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
dying of thirst, blinded by dust, under a sun as
destructive as the balls, and with the constant
sickening fear of infection from dead bodies.</p>

<p>Yet a charming young woman was there with
them,&mdash;an Austrian, to whom should be given
one of our most beautiful French crosses. Alone
amongst men in distress, she kept an even cheerfulness
of the best kind, she cared for the wounded,
prepared food for the sick sailors with her own
hands, and then went off to aid in carrying bricks
and sand for the barricades or to take her turn as
watch on the roof.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Day by day the circle closed in upon the besieged
as their ranks grew thinner and the garden
filled with the dead; gradually they lost ground,
although disputing with the enemy, who were
legion, every piece of wall, every pile of bricks.</p>

<p>And when one sees their little barricades hastily
erected during the night out of nothing at all, and
knows that five or six sailors succeeded in defending
them (for five or six toward the end were all
that could be spared), it really seems as though
there were something supernatural about it all.
As I walked through the garden with one of its
defenders, and he said to me, "At the foot of
that little wall we held out for so many days,"
and "In front of this little barricade we resisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
for a week," it seemed a marvellous tale of
heroism.</p>

<p>And their last intrenchment! It was alongside
the house,&mdash;a ditch dug tentatively in a single
night, banked up with a few poor sacks of earth
and sand; it was all they had to keep out the executioners,
who, scarcely six metres away, were
threatening them with death from the top of a
wall.</p>

<p>Beyond is the "cemetery," that is, the corner
of the garden in which they buried their dead, until
the still more terrible days when they had to put
them here and there, concealing the place for fear
the graves would be violated, in accordance with
the terrible custom of this place. It was a poor
little cemetery whose soil had been pressed and
trampled upon in close combat, whose trees were
shattered and broken by shell. The interments
took place under Chinese fire, and an old white-headed
priest&mdash;since a martyr, whose head was
dragged in the gutter&mdash;said prayers at the grave,
in spite of the balls that whistled about him, cutting
and breaking the branches.</p>

<p>Toward the end their cemetery was the "contested
region," after they had little by little lost
much ground, and they trembled for their dead;
the enemy had advanced to its very border; they
watched and they killed at close quarters over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
sleeping warriors so hastily put to rest. If the
Chinese had reached this cemetery, and had scaled
the last frail trenches of sand and gravel in sacks
made of old curtains, then for all who were left
there would have been horrible torture to the sound
of music and laughter, horrible dismemberment,&mdash;nails
torn out, feet torn off, disembowelling,
and finally the head carried through the streets at
the end of a pole.</p>

<p>They were attacked from all sides and in every
possible manner, often at the most unexpected
hours of the night. It usually began with cries and
the sudden noise of trumpets and tam-tams; around
them thousands of howling men would appear,&mdash;one
must have heard the howlings of the Chinese
to imagine what their voices are; their very timbre
chills your soul. Gongs outside the walls added to
the tumult.</p>

<p>Occasionally, from a suddenly opened hole in a
neighboring house, a pole twenty or thirty feet
long, ablaze at the end with oakum and petroleum,
emerged slowly and silently, like a thing out of
a dream. This was applied to the roofs in the
hope of setting them on fire.</p>

<p>They were also attacked from below, they heard
dull sounds in the earth, and understood that they
were being undermined, that their executioners
might spring up from the ground at any moment;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
so that it became necessary, at any cost, to attempt
to establish countermines to prevent this subterranean
peril. One day, toward noon, two terrible detonations,
which brought on a regular tornado of
plaster and dust, shook the French legation, half
burying under rubbish the lieutenant in command
of the defences and several of his marines. But
this was not all; all but two succeeded in getting
clear of the stones and ashes that covered them to
the shoulders, but two brave sailors never appeared
again. And so the struggle continued, desperately,
and under conditions more and more frightful.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And still the gentle stranger remained, when she
might so easily have taken shelter elsewhere,&mdash;at
the English legation, for instance, where most
of the ministers with their families had found
refuge; the balls did not penetrate to them; they
were at the centre of the quarter defended by a
few handfuls of brave soldiers, and could there feel
a certain security so long as the barricades held
out. But no, she remained and continued in her
admirable rôle at that blazing point, the French
legation,&mdash;a point which was the key, the cornerstone
of the European quadrangle, whose capture
would bring about general disaster.</p>

<p>One time they saw with their field glasses the
posting of an imperial edict commanding that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
fire against foreigners cease. (What they did <i>not</i>
see was that the men who put up the notices were
attacked by the crowd with knives.) Yet a certain
lull, a sort of armistice did follow; the attacks
became less violent.</p>

<p>They saw that incendiaries were everywhere
abroad; they heard fusillades, cannonades, and
prolonged cries among the Chinese; entire districts
were in flames; they were killing one another;
their fury was fermenting as in a pandemonium,
and they were suffocated, stifled with
the smell of corpses.</p>

<p>Spies came occasionally with information to sell&mdash;always
false and contradictory&mdash;in regard to
the relief expedition, which amid ever-increasing
anxiety was hourly expected. "It is here, it is
there, it is advancing," or "It has been defeated
and is retreating," were the announcements, yet
it persisted in not appearing.</p>

<p>What, then, was Europe doing? Had they
been abandoned? They continued, almost without
hope, to defend themselves in their restricted
quarters. Each day they felt that Chinese torture
and death were closing in upon them.</p>

<p>They began to lack for the essentials of life.
It was necessary to economize in everything, particularly
in ammunition; they were growing savage,&mdash;when
they captured any Boxers, instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
of shooting them they broke their skulls with a
revolver.</p>

<p>One day their ears, sharpened for all outside
noises, distinguished a continued deep, heavy cannonade
beyond the great black ramparts whose
battlements were visible in the distance, and which
enclosed them in a Dantesque circle; Pekin was
being bombarded! It could only be by the armies
of Europe come to their assistance.</p>

<p>Yet one last fear troubled their joy. Would not
a supreme attack against them be attempted, an
effort be made to destroy them before the allied
troops could enter?</p>

<p>As a matter of fact they were furiously attacked,
and this last day, the day of their deliverance,
cost the life of one of our officers, Captain
Labrousse, who went to join the Austrian commander
in the glorious little cemetery of the legation.
But they kept up their resistance, until all
at once not a Chinese head was visible on the barricades
of the enemy; all was empty and silent in
the devastation about them; the Boxers were flying
and the Allies were entering the city!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This first night of my arrival in Pekin was as
melancholy as the nights on the road, but in a
more commonplace way, with more of <i>ennui</i>. The
workmen had just finished the walls of my room;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the fresh plaster gave forth a chilling dampness
that penetrated to my very bones, and as the room
was empty, my servant spread my narrow mattress
from the junk upon the floor, and began to
make a table out of some old boxes.</p>

<p>My hosts were good enough to have a stove
hastily set up for me and lighted, which called up
a picture of European discomfort in some wretched
place in the country. How could one fancy oneself
in China, in Pekin itself, so near to mysterious enclosures,
to palaces so full of wonders?</p>

<p>As to the French minister, whom I am anxious
to see, to convey to him the admiral's communications,
I learn that he, having no roof to cover his
head, has gone to seek shelter at the Spanish legation;
and furthermore, that he has typhoid fever,
which is epidemic on account of the poisonous
condition of the water, so that for the present no
one can see him. So my stay in this damp place
threatens to be more prolonged than I anticipated.
Through the window-panes covered with moisture
I gloomily look out onto a court filled with broken
furniture, where the twilight is falling and the
snow.</p>

<p>Who could have foreseen that to-morrow, by
an unexpected turn of fortune, I should be sleeping
on a great gilded, imperial bed in a strange
fairyland in the heart of the Forbidden City?</p>

<h3>VIII</h3>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Friday</span>, October 19.<br />
</div>

<p>I awake benumbed with the damp cold of my
poor lodging; water drips down the walls and
the stove smokes.</p>

<p>I go off to perform a commission entrusted to
me by the admiral for the commander-in-chief of
our land troops, General Voyron, who lives in a
small house near by. In the division of the mysterious
Yellow City, made by the heads of the
allied troops, one of the palaces of the Empress
fell to our general. He installed himself there
for the winter, not far from the palace which was
to be occupied by one of our allies, Field-Marshal
von Waldersee, and there he has graciously offered
me hospitality. He himself leaves for Tien-Tsin
to-day, so for the week or two which his trip will
occupy I shall be there alone with his aide-de-camp,
one of my old comrades, who has charge
of adapting this residence from fairyland to the
needs of military service.</p>

<p>What a change it will be from my plastered
walls and charcoal stove!</p>

<p>My flight to the Yellow City will not take place
till to-morrow morning, for my friend, the aide-de-camp,
expresses his kindly wish to arrive before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
me at our palace, where some confusion
reigns, and to prepare the place for me.</p>

<p>So, having no further duties to-day, I accept
the offer of one of the members of the French
legation to go with him to see the Temple of
Heaven. It has stopped snowing, the cold north
wind has chased away the clouds, and the sun is
shining resplendently in the pale blue sky.</p>

<p>According to the map of Pekin, this Temple of
Heaven is five or six kilometres from here, and is
the largest of all the temples. It seems that it is
situated in the midst of a park of venerable trees
surrounded by double walls. Up to the time of
the war the spot was unapproachable; the emperors
came once a year and shut themselves up
there for a solemn sacrifice, preceded by purifications
and preparatory rites.</p>

<p>To reach it we have to go outside of all the
ashes and ruins, outside of the Tartar City where
we are staying, through the gigantic gates of the
terrible walls, and penetrate to the Chinese City
itself.</p>

<p>These two walled cities, which together make
up Pekin, are two immense quadrilaterals placed
side by side; one, the Tartar City, contains in a
fortress-like enclosure the Yellow City, where I
go to-morrow to take up my abode.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 900px;">
<img src="images/i095.jpg" width="900" height="632" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Chen-Mun Gate to Pekin</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>As we come through the separating wall and see
the Chinese City framed by the colossal gateway,
we are surprised to find a great artery, stately and
full of life as in the old days, running straight
through Pekin, which up to this time had seemed
like a necropolis to us; the gold decorations, the
color, the thousand forms of monsters were all
unexpected, as well as the sudden aggression of
noises, of music, and voices. This life, this agitation,
this Chinese splendor, are inconceivable, inexplicable
to us; such an abyss of dissimilarity
lies between this world and ours!</p>

<p>The great artery stretches on before us broad
and straight,&mdash;a road three or four kilometres
long, leading finally to another monumental gate
which appears in the distance, surmounted by a
dungeon with an absurd roof. This is an opening
through a wall beyond which is the outside solitude.
The low houses which line the street on
both sides seem to be made of gold lace, from top
to bottom the open woodwork of their façades
glitters; they are finely carved at the top, all shining
with gold, with gargoyles similar to our own,
and rows of gilded dragons. Black stele covered
with gold letters rise much higher than the houses,
from which jut out black and gold lacquered platforms
for the support of strange emblems with
horns and claws and monsters' faces.</p>

<p>Through the clouds of dust, the gilding, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
dragons, and the chimæras glisten in the dusty
sunlight as far as one can see. Above it all
triumphal arches of astonishing lightness mount
heavenward across the avenue; they are airy
things of carved wood, with supports like the
masts of a ship, which repeat against the pale
blue ether more strange hostile forms, horns,
claws, and fantastic beasts.</p>

<p>On the broad highway where one treads as
upon ashes, there is a dull rumbling of caravans
and horses. The stupendous Mongolian camels,
brown and woolly, attached to one another in long
endless files, pass slowly and solemnly along, unceasingly
like the waters of a river, raising as they
walk the powdery bed which stifles the sounds
of this entire city. They are going, who knows
where, into the depths of the Thibetan or Mongolian
deserts, carrying in the same indefatigable
and unconscious way thousands of bales of merchandise;
taking the place of canals and rivers
which convey barges and junks over immense
distances. So heavy is the dust raised by their
feet that they can scarcely lift them; the legs of
these innumerable camels in procession, as well
as the lower parts of the houses, and the garments
of the passers-by, are all vague and confused
in outline, as though seen through the thick
smoke of a forge, or through a shower of dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
wool; but the backs of the great beasts with their
shaggy coats, emerging from the soft clouds near
the earth, are almost sharply defined, and the gold
of the façades, tarnished below, shines brightly at
the height of the extravagant cornices.</p>

<p>It seems like a phantasmagoric city with no
real foundations, resting upon a cloud, a heavy
cloud, whereon gigantic sheep, with necks enlarged
by a thick brown fleece, move inoffensively.</p>

<p>Above the dust the sun shines clear and white,
making resplendent the cold, penetrating light in
which things stand out incisively. Objects that
are high up above the ground stand out with absolute
clearness. The smallest of small monsters on
the top of the triumphal arches may be clearly
seen, as well as the most delicate carving on the
summits of the stele; one can even count the teeth,
the forked tongues, the squinting eyes of the hundreds
of gold chimæras which jut from the roofs.</p>

<p>Pekin, the city of carvings and gildings, the
city of claws and horns, is still capable of creating
illusions; on dry, sunny, windy days it recovers
something of its splendor under the dust of the
steppes, under the veil which then masks the shabbiness
of its streets and the squalor of its crowds.</p>

<p>Yet all is old and worn in spite of the gilding
which still remains bright. In this quarter there
was continual fighting during the siege of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
legations, the Boxers destroying the homes of
those whom they suspected of sympathy for the
barbarians.</p>

<p>The long avenue which we have been following
for half an hour ends now at an arched bridge of
white marble, still a superb object; here the houses
come to an end, and on the opposite bank the
gloomy steppes begin.</p>

<p>This was the Bridge of the Beggars,&mdash;dangerous
inhabitants, who, before the capture of Pekin,
ranged themselves on both sides of its long railing
and extorted money from the passers-by; they
formed a bold corporation with a king at its head,
who often went armed. Their place is unoccupied
to-day; the vagrants departed after the battles and
massacres began.</p>

<p>Beyond this bridge a gray plain, empty and
desolate, extends for two kilometres, as far as the
Great Wall, far beyond where Pekin ends. The
road, with its tide of caravans, goes straight on
through this solitude to the outside gate. Why
should this desert be enclosed by the city's walls?
There is not a trace of previous constructions; it
must always have been as it is. No one is in sight
on it; a few stray dogs, a few rags, a few bones,
and that is all.</p>

<p>For a long distance into this steppe there are
sombre red walls at both right and left which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
seem to enclose great cedar woods. The enclosure
at the right is that of the Temple of Agriculture;
at the left is the Temple of Heaven, for which we
are bound. We plunge into this gloomy region,
leaving the dust and the crowds behind.</p>

<p>The enclosure around the Temple of Heaven
has a circumference of more than six kilometres;
it is one of the most extensive in the whole
city, where everything is on an old-time scale of
grandeur which overpowers us to-day. The gate
which was formerly impassable will not close now,
and we enter the wood of venerable trees&mdash;cedars,
arbor-vitæ, and willows&mdash;through which long
avenues have been cut. This spot, accustomed to
silence and respect, is now profaned by barbarian
cavalry. Several thousand Indians sent out to
China by England are encamped there; their
horses have trampled the grass; the turf and the
moss are filled with rubbish and manure. From
a marble terrace where incense to the gods was
formerly burned, clouds of infected smoke were
rising, the English having chosen this place for
the burning of cattle that die of the plague, and
for the manufacture of bone-black.</p>

<p>There are, as in all sacred woods, two enclosures.
The secondary temples, scattered amongst
the cedars, precede the great central temple.</p>

<p>Never having been here before, we are guided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
by our judgment toward something which must
be it, higher than anything else, above the tops
of the trees,&mdash;a distant rotunda with a roof of
blue enamel, surmounted by a gold sphere which
glistens in the sunshine.</p>

<p>The rotunda, when we finally reach it, proves
to be the sanctuary itself. Its approaches are
silent; there are no more horses or barbarian
riders. It stands on a high esplanade of white
marble reached by a series of steps and by an
"imperial path," reserved for the Son of Heaven,
who is not permitted to mount stairs. An "imperial
path" is an inclined plane, usually an enormous
monolith of marble placed at an easy angle,
upon which the five-clawed dragon is sculptured
in bas-relief; the scales of the great heraldic animal,
its coils and its nails, serve to sustain the
Emperor's steps and to prevent his feet, dressed
in silk, from slipping on the strange path reserved
for Him alone, and which no Chinese would dare
to tread.</p>

<p>We mount irreverently by this "imperial path,"
scratching the fine white scales of the dragon with
our coarse shoes.</p>

<p>From the top of the lonely terrace, melancholy
and everlastingly white with the unchanging
whiteness of marble, one sees above the trees
of the wood, great Pekin in its dust, which the
sun is beginning to gild as it gilds the tiny evening
clouds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<span class="smcap">The Temple of Heaven</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>The gate of the temple is open, and guarded
by an Indian trooper with oblong sphynx-like
eyes, as out of his element as we in this ultra-Chinese
and sacred environment. He salutes us
and permits us to enter.</p>

<p>The circular temple is bright with red and gold
and has a roof of blue enamel; it is a new temple
built to replace a very old one which was burned
ten years ago. The altar is bare, it is bare everywhere;
plunderers have passed over it, leaving
nothing but the marble pavements, the beautiful
lacquered ceilings, and the walls; the tall columns
of red lacquer, arranged in the form of a circle,
all taper uniformly and are decorated with garlands
of gold flowers.</p>

<p>On the esplanade around it, weeds have pushed
their way here and there between the carved stones
of the pavement, attesting the extreme age of the
marble in spite of its immaculate whiteness. It is
a commanding place, erected at great expense for
the contemplation of the sovereigns, and we linger,
like the Sons of Heaven themselves, to gaze upon it.</p>

<p>In our immediate vicinity the tops of the arbor-vitæ
and the cedars,&mdash;the great wood which envelops
us in calm and silence,&mdash;come first. Then,
toward the north is the endless but obscure city,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
which seems almost unreal; one divines rather
than sees it, so hidden is it in the smoke or fog
which forms a gauzy veil. It might be a mirage
were it not for the monumental roofs of exaggerated
proportions, whose tops of shining enamel
emerge from the fog here and there, clear and
real; these are palaces and pagodas. Beyond
all this, very far away, is the crest of the mountains
of Mongolia, which to-night have no base
and seem to be cut out of blue and red paper high
up in the air. Toward the west is the gray steppe
through which we have come; the slow procession
of caravans crossing it marks upon it as far
as the eye can see an uninterrupted brown path;
we realize that this endless procession goes on
for hundreds of miles, and that on all the great
roads of China, to its most distant frontiers, similar
processions are moving with identical slowness.</p>

<p>It is the old unchanging method of communication
between these men so different from
ourselves,&mdash;men with perseverance and infinite
patience, for whom the march of time, which unsteadies
us, does not exist; it forms for them
the arterial circulation of this boundless empire,
where four or five hundred million brains&mdash;the
reverse of our own and forever incomprehensible
to us&mdash;live and speculate.</p>

<h2>IV<br />
IN THE IMPERIAL CITY</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Saturday</span>, October 20.<br />
</div>

<p>It snows. The sky is lowering and overcast,
with no hope of clearing, as though there were
no longer any sun. A furious north wind is
blowing, and the black dust whirls and eddies,
commingling with the snowflakes.</p>

<p>This morning, my first interview with our minister
took place at the Spanish legation. His temperature
has fallen, but he is still very weak, and
must remain in bed for some days, so I am obliged
to postpone until to-morrow or the day after the
communications I have to make to him.</p>

<p>I take my last meal with the members of the
French legation in the chancellor's house, where,
in default of sumptuous quarters, they have offered
me the most kindly hospitality. At half-past one
the two little Chinese chariots arrive, lent me for
the emigration of myself, my people, and my light
luggage to the Yellow City.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>The Chinese chariots are very small, very massive,
very heavy, and entirely without springs;
mine has something of the elegance of a hearse;
the outside is covered with a slaty-gray silk, with
a wide border of black velvet.</p>

<p>We are to journey toward the northwest, in the
opposite direction from the Chinese City where
we were yesterday, and from the Temple of
Heaven. We have five or six kilometres to go
almost at a walk, on account of the pitiable condition
of the streets and bridges, where most of
the paving stones are missing.</p>

<p>These Chinese chariots cannot be closed; they
are like a simple sentry box mounted on wheels,&mdash;so
to-day we are lashed by the wind, cut by the
snow, blinded by the dust.</p>

<p>First come the ruins of the legation district, full
of soldiers. Then more lonely, almost deserted
and entirely Chinese ruins&mdash;one gray, dusty devastation,
seen vaguely through clouds of black
and clouds of white. At the gates and on the
bridges are European or Japanese sentinels, for the
whole city is under military rule. From time to
time we meet soldiers and ambulances carrying the
flag of the Red-Cross Society.</p>

<p>At last the first enclosure of the Yellow or
Imperial City is announced by the interpreter of
the French legation, who has kindly offered to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
my guide, and to share my chariot with its funeral
trappings. I try to look, but the wind burns my
eyes.</p>

<p>We are passing with frightful jolts through
great blood-colored ramparts, not by way of a
gate, but through a breach made with a mine by
Indian cavalrymen.</p>

<p>Pekin, on the farther side of this wall, is somewhat
less injured. In some of the streets the
houses have kept their outside covering of gilded
woodwork and their rows of chimæras along the
edges of the roofs; all this is crumbling and decayed,
it is true, licked by the flames or riddled by
grape-shot. An evil-looking rabble, dressed in
sheepskins or blue cotton rags, still swarms in
some of the houses.</p>

<p>Another rampart of the same blood red and a
great gate ornamented with faience through which
we must pass,&mdash;this time it is the real gate of the
Imperial City, the gate of the region which no one
was ever allowed to enter; it is to me as though it
had been announced as the gate to mystery or to
an enchanted land.</p>

<p>We enter, and my surprise is great; for it is not
a city, but a wood,&mdash;a sombre wood, infested
with crows which croak in the gray branches. The
trees are the same as those at the Temple of
Heaven,&mdash;cedars, arbor-vitæ, and willows,&mdash;old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
trees all of them, of twisted shapes, unknown
in our country. Sleet and snow cling to their
branches, and the inevitable dust in the narrow,
windy paths engulfs us.</p>

<p>There are also wooded hills where kiosks of
faience rise among the cedars; in spite of their
height, it is plain that they are artificial. Obscured
by the snow and dust, we can see here and there
in the distant wood austere old palaces, with enamelled
roofs, guarded by horrible marble monsters
which crouch at the thresholds.</p>

<p>The whole place is of an incontestable beauty,
while at the same time it is dismal, unfriendly,
and disturbing under this sombre sky.</p>

<p>Now we approach some enormous object which
we shall soon be alongside of. Is it a fortress,
a prison, or something more lugubrious still?
Double ramparts without end, always blood red,
with gloomy dungeons and a moat thirty metres
wide, full of water-lilies and dying roses. This
is the Violet City, enclosed in the heart of the impenetrable
Imperial City, and more impenetrable
still. It is the residence of the Invisible, of the
Son of Heaven&mdash;God! but the place is gloomy,
hostile, savage, beneath this sombre sky!</p>

<p>We continue to advance under the old trees into
what seems the park of death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 900px;">
<img src="images/i111.jpg" width="900" height="560" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Marble Bridge over Moat before Southern Gate of the Forbidden City</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>These dumb, closed palaces, seen first on one
side, then on the other, are the Temple of the God
of the Clouds, the Temple of Imperial Longevity,
or the Temple of the Benediction of Sacred Mountains.
Their names, inconceivable to us, the names
of an Asiatic dream, make them still more unreal.</p>

<p>My companion assures me that this Yellow City
is not always so terrible as it is to-day; for this
weather is exceptional in a Chinese autumn, which
is usually magnificently luminous. He promises
me afternoons of warm sunshine in this wood,
unique in all the world, where I shall make my
home for several days.</p>

<p>"Now look," he said, "look! This is the Lake
of the Lotus, and that is the Marble Bridge."</p>

<p>The Lake of the Lotus and the Marble Bridge!
These two names have long been known to me as
the names of things <i>which could not be seen</i>, but
of things whose reputations had crossed insurmountable
walls. They call up images of light
and intense color, and are a surprise to me here
in this mournful desert, in this icy wind.</p>

<p>The Lake of the Lotus! I had pictured it as
sung by the Chinese poets, of an exquisite limpidity
with great calices open to an abundance of water,
a sort of aquatic plain covered with pink flowers,
pink from one end to the other. And this is it!&mdash;This
slime and this gloomy swamp, covered
with dead leaves turned brown by the frost! It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
is infinitely larger than I supposed, this lake made
by the hand of man; it goes on and on toward
nostalgic shores, where ancient pagodas appear
among the old trees, under the gray sky.</p>

<p>The Marble Bridge! Yes, this long, white arch
supported by a series of white pillars, this exceedingly
graceful curve, the balustrades with monsters'
heads,&mdash;this all corresponds to the idea I
had of it; it is very sumptuous and very Chinese.
I had not, however, foreseen the two dead bodies
decaying in their robes, which lay among the reeds
at the entrance to the bridge.</p>

<p>The large dead leaves on the lake are really
lotus-leaves; I recognize them now that I see
them near at hand, and remember to have seen
similar ones&mdash;but oh, so green and fresh&mdash;on
the ponds of Nagasaki or of Yeddo. And there
once must have been here the effect of an uninterrupted
covering of pink blossoms; their fading
stems rise now by thousands above the slime.</p>

<p>They will undoubtedly die, these fields of lotus,
which for centuries have charmed the eyes of the
emperors, for the lake is almost empty; it is the
Allies who have turned its water into the canal
that connects Pekin with the river, in order to
re-establish this route which the Chinese had dried
up for fear of its serving the purpose of the
invaders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>The Marble Bridge, white and solitary, leads
us across to the other bank of the lake, very narrow
at this point, and there I shall find the Palace
of the North, which is to be my residence. At first
I do not see that there are enclosures within enclosures,
all with great gates, dilapidated and in
ruins. A dull light falls from the wintry sky
through opaque clouds that are filled with snow.</p>

<p>In the centre of a gray wall there is a breach
where an African chasseur is on guard; on one
side lies a dead dog, on the other a pile of rags
and filth breathing a corpse-like odor. This, it
appears, is the entrance to my palace.</p>

<p>We are black with dust, powdered with snow,
and our teeth are chattering with cold, when we
finally get down from our chariot in a court encumbered
with débris, where my comrade, Captain
C., the aide-de-camp, comes to meet me.
With an approach like this, one well might wonder
if the promised palace were not chimerical.</p>

<p>Just back of this court there is, however, the first
appearance of magnificence. Here and there is a
long gallery of glass, light, elegant, and apparently
intact, amid so much destruction. Through
the panes one has glimpses of gold, porcelains, and
imperial silks with designs of dragons and clouds.
This is one corner of the palace, completely hidden
until you are right upon it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Oh, our evening meal on the night of our
arrival in this strange dwelling! It is almost
totally dark. At an ebony table my companion and
I are seated, wrapped in our military cloaks
with collars turned up, our teeth chattering with
cold, and are served by our orderlies with trembling
limbs. A feeble little Chinese candle of red
wax, stuck in a bottle,&mdash;a candle picked up in the
débris from some ancestral altar,&mdash;sheds a dim
light, blown as it is by the wind. Our plates, in
fact all the dishes, are of porcelain of inestimable
value,&mdash;imperial yellow, marked with the cipher
of a fastidious emperor, who was a contemporary
of Louis XV. But our wine and our muddy water&mdash;boiled
and reboiled for fear of poison in the
wells&mdash;are in horrible old bottles with bits of
potato, cut into shape by the soldiers, for corks.</p>

<p>The gallery where this scene takes place is very
long; the distance is lost in obscurity where the
splendors of an Asiatic tale are dimly perceived.
Its sides are of glass up to the height of a man,
and this frail wall is all that separates us from the
sinister darkness which surrounds us; one has a
feeling that the wandering forms outside, the
phantoms attracted by our small light, may from
a distance see us at table, and this is disturbing.
Above the glass there is a series of light frames
containing rice-paper, which reach to the ceiling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
from which marvellous ebony sculptures depend,
delicate as lacework; this rice-paper is torn, and
allows the mortally cold night wind to strike us.
Our frozen feet rest on imperial yellow carpets
of the finest wool, with the five-horned dragons
sprawling upon them. Close to us gigantic incense-burners
of cloisonné of the old inimitable
blue, with gold elephants as pedestals, are softly
burning; there are magnificent and fanciful
screens; ph&oelig;nixes of enamel spread their long
wings; thrones, monsters, things without age and
without price abound. And there we are, inelegant,
dusty, worn, soiled, with the air of coarse
barbarians, installed like intruders in fairyland.</p>

<p>What must this gallery have been scarcely three
months ago, when instead of silence and death
there was life, music, and flowers; when a crowd
of courtiers and servants in silken robes peopled
these approaches so empty and ruined to-day;
when the Empress, followed by the ladies of the
palace, passed by dressed like goddesses!</p>

<p>Having finished our supper, which consisted of
the regular army ration, having finished drinking
our tea out of museum-like porcelain, now for the
hour of smoking and conversation. No, we try in
vain to think it amusing to be here, in this unforeseen
and half fantastic way. It is too cold;
the wind chills us to the marrow. We do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
enjoy anything. We prefer to go off and to try
to sleep.</p>

<p>My comrade, Captain C., who has taken possession
of the place, leads me with a lantern and
a few followers to the apartment set aside for me.
It is on the <i>rez-de-chausée</i>, of course; there are no
real stories in Chinese houses. As in the gallery,
from which we come, there is nothing between me
and the night outside but a few panes of glass,
very light shades of white silk, and windows of
rice-paper torn from one end to the other. As
to the door, which is made of one great pane of
glass, I fasten it with a cord, since there is no
lock.</p>

<p>There are some admirable yellow rugs on the
floor, thick as cushions. I have a big imperial bed
of carved ebony, and my mattress and pillows are
covered with precious silk embroidered in gold,
but there are no sheets, although I have a soldier's
gray woollen blanket.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To-morrow my companion tells me I may go
and select from her Majesty's reserve supply whatever
I wish in the way of further decorations for
this room, as it can do no one any harm to move
things about.</p>

<p>Assuring me that the gates of the outer enclosure,
as well as the breach by which I entered, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
guarded by sentinels, he retires with his orderlies
to the other end of the palace.</p>

<p>Dressed, and with my boots on, I stretch myself
out on the beautiful silk cushions, adding to my
gray blanket an old sheepskin and two or three
imperial robes embroidered with gold chimæras.
My two servants arrange themselves in like manner
on the floor. Before blowing out the red
candle from some ancestral altar, I am constrained
to admit in my secret soul that the accusation that
we are "Occidental barbarians" has been completely
confirmed since supper.</p>

<p>The wind has tormented and torn all that was
left of the rice-paper in my panes; above me there
is a perpetual sound like the movement of the
wings of nocturnal birds or the flight of bats.
I distinguish occasionally, although half asleep, a
short fusillade or an isolated cry in the distance.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Sunday</span>, October 21.<br />
</div>

<p>Cold, darkness, death, all that oppressed us last
night, has disappeared with the morning light.
The sun shines warm as a summer sun. The
somewhat disordered Chinese magnificence which
surrounds us is bright with the light of the
East.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>It is amusing to go on a voyage of discovery
over this almost hidden palace, which lurks in
a low spot, behind walls, under trees, looking
quite insignificant as you approach it, but is, together
with its dependencies, almost as large as a
city.</p>

<p>It is made up of long galleries enclosed on all
sides in glass; the light framework, the verandahs,
the small columns, are painted on the outside a
greenish bronze decorated with pink water-lilies.</p>

<p>One has the feeling that it was built according
to the fancies of a woman; it even seems as though
the splendid old Empress had left in it, along with
her bibelots, a touch of her superannuated yet still
charming grace.</p>

<p>The galleries cross one another at right angles,
forming courts at the junctures, like little cloisters.
They are filled with objects of art, which can be
equally well seen from without, for the entire
palace is transparent from one end to the other.
There is nothing to protect all this glass even at
night; the place was enclosed by so many walls
and seemed so inviolable that no other precaution
was deemed necessary.</p>

<p>Within, the architectural elegance consists of
arches of rare wood, crossing at frequent intervals;
they are made of enormous beams so
carved, so leafy, so open, that they seem like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
lace, or, rather, like bowers of dark leaves that
form a perspective comparable to the lanes in old
parks.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The wing which we occupy must have been the
wing of honor. The farther away from it one
goes in the direction of the woods where the palace
ends, the more simple does the decoration become.
At one end are the lodgings of the mandarins, the
stewards, the gardeners, the domestics, all hurriedly
abandoned and full of unfamiliar objects,
household utensils or those used in worship, ceremonial
hats and court liveries.</p>

<p>Then comes an enclosed garden which is entered
by an elaborately carved marble gate. Here one
finds small fountains, pretentious and curious
rockwork, and rows of vases containing plants
which have died from lack of water or from cold.
Further on there is an orchard where figs, grapes,
eggplant, pumpkins, and gourds were cultivated,&mdash;gourds
especially, for in China they are emblems
of happiness, and it was the custom of the
Empress to offer one with her own white hands to
each of the dignitaries who came to pay his court
to her in exchange for the magnificent presents
he brought her. There are also small pavilions
for the cultivation of silkworms and little kiosks
for storing edible grains; each kind was kept in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
a porcelain jar decorated with imperial dragons,
worthy of a place in a museum.</p>

<p>The parks of this artificial little landscape end
in the brush, where they lose themselves under the
leafless trees of the wood where to-day the crows
and the magpies are enjoying the beautiful autumn
sun. It seems that when the Empress gave up the
regency&mdash;and we know by what an audacious
man&oelig;uvre she so quickly managed to take it up
again&mdash;it was her caprice to construct a bit of
the country here in the heart of Pekin, in the very
centre of this immense human ant-hill.</p>

<p>The most surprising thing in all this enclosure
is a Gothic church with two granite bell-towers, a
parsonage, and a school,&mdash;all built in other days
by the missionaries and all of enormous size. But
in order to create this palace it was necessary to
enlarge the limits of the Imperial City and to
include in them this Christian territory; so the
Empress gave the Lazarist Fathers more land and
a more beautiful church, erected at her own expense,
where the missionaries and several thousand
converts endured all last summer the horrors of a
four-months' siege.</p>

<p>Like the systematic woman that she was, her
Majesty utilized the church and its dependencies
for storing her reserves of all sorts, packed in
innumerable boxes. One could not imagine without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
having seen them what an accumulation there
could be of the strange, the marvellous, and the
preposterous in the reserve stock of bibelots belonging
to an Empress of China.</p>

<p>The Japanese were the first to forage there,
then came the Cossacks, and, lastly, the Germans,
who left the place to us. At present the church is
in indescribable disorder,&mdash;boxes opened, their
precious contents scattered outside in rubbish
heaps; there are streams of broken china, cascades
of enamel, ivory, and porcelain.</p>

<p>In the long glass galleries a similar state of
things exists. My comrade, who is charged with
straightening out the chaos and making an inventory,
reminds me of that person who was shut
up by an evil spirit in a chamber filled with the
feathers of all the birds of the woods and compelled
to sort them by species; those of the finch,
the linnet, the bullfinch together. However, he
has already set about his difficult task, and with
Chinese workmen, under the direction of a few
marines and some African chasseurs, has already
begun to clear things away.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Five metres from here, on the opposite shores
of the Lake of the Lotus, as I was retracing my
steps last night, I found a second palace which
once belonged to the Empress, which is now ours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
also. In this palace, which no one is occupying
at the moment, I am authorized to set up my
work-room for a few days, so that I may have
quiet and isolation.</p>

<p>It is called the Rotunda Palace. Exactly opposite
the Marble Bridge, it resembles a circular
fortress, on which have been placed small miradors,&mdash;little,
fairy-like castles,&mdash;and the single
low entrance is guarded day and night by soldiers,
whose orders are to admit no one.</p>

<p>When you have crossed the threshold of this
citadel, and the guards have closed the door after
you, you penetrate into the most exquisite solitude.
An inclined plane leads you to a vast esplanade
about twelve metres above the ground,
where the miradors&mdash;the little kiosks&mdash;seen
from below stand; there is a garden with old,
old trees, a labyrinth of rocks, and a large pagoda
shining with gold and enamel.</p>

<p>From here there is a commanding view of the
palace and its park. On one side the Lake of the
Lotus is spread out; on the other, one has a
bird's-eye view of the Violet City, showing the
almost endless succession of high imperial roofs,&mdash;a
world of roofs, a world of enamel shining in
the sunshine, a world of horns, claws, and monsters
on gable and tiling.</p>

<p>I walk in the solitude of this high place, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
shade of the old trees, trying to understand the
arrangement of the house and to choose a study
to my fancy.</p>

<p>In the centre of the esplanade is the magnificent
pagoda which was struck by a shell and which is
still in battle disarray. Its presiding divinity&mdash;a
white goddess, who was the Palladium of the
Chinese empire, an alabaster goddess with a gold
dress embroidered with precious stones&mdash;meditates
with downcast eyes, sweet, calm, and smiling,
in the midst of the destruction of her sacred
vases, of her incense-burners and her flowers.</p>

<p>One large gloomy room has kept its furnishings
intact,&mdash;an admirable ebony throne, some
screens, seats of all shapes, and cushions of heavy
yellow imperial silk, brocaded with a cloud effect.</p>

<p>Among all the silent kiosks the one which I fix
upon as my choice is at the very edge of the esplanade
on the crest of the surrounding wall, overlooking
the Lake of the Lotus and the Marble
Bridge, and commanding a view of the whole
factitious landscape,&mdash;created out of gold ingots
and human lives to please the weary eyes of
emperors.</p>

<p>It is hardly larger than a ship's cabin, but its
sides are made of glass extending to the roof, so
that I shall be kept warm until nightfall by the
autumn sun, which here in China is seldom over-clouded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
I have a table and two ebony chairs
with yellow silk coverings brought in from the
adjoining room,&mdash;and thus installed, I descend
again to the Marble Bridge and return to the
Palace of the North, where Captain C., my companion
in this Chinese dream, is waiting breakfast
for me.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I arrive in time to see, before they are burned,
the curious discoveries of the morning,&mdash;the decorations,
emblems, and accessories of the Chinese
Imperial Theatre. They were cumbersome, frail
things, intended to serve but for a night or two,
and then forgotten for an indefinite time in a
room that was never opened, and which they are
now clearing out and cleaning for a hospital for
our sick and wounded. Mythological representations
were evidently given at this theatre, the
scene taking place either in hell or with the gods
in the clouds; and such a collection as there was
of monsters, chimæras, wild beasts, and devils,
in cardboard or paper, mounted on carcasses made
of bamboo or whalebone, all devised with a perfect
genius for the horrible, with an imagination
surpassing the limits of a nightmare!</p>

<p>The rats, the dampness, and the ants have
caused irremediable havoc among them, so it has
been decided to burn all these figures that have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
served to amuse or to trouble the dreams of the
drowsy, dissipated, feeble young Emperor.</p>

<p>Our soldiers are hurrying amid joy and laughter
to carry all these things out of doors. Here
in the morning sunlight of the courtyard are
apocalyptic beasts and life-sized elephants that
weigh nothing at all, and which one man can
make walk or run. They kick them, they jump
upon them, they jump into them, they walk
through them and reduce them to nothing; then
at last they light the gay torch, which in the
twinkling of an eye consumes them.</p>

<p>Other soldiers have been working all the morning
pasting rice-paper into the sashes of our palace
so that the wind shall not enter. As for artificial
heat, it comes up from below, Chinese fashion,
from subterranean furnaces which are arranged
under the rooms, and which we shall light this
evening as soon as the chill comes on. For the
moment the splendid sunshine suffices; so much
glass in the galleries, where the silks, enamels,
and gold glisten, gives us the heat of a greenhouse,
and on this occasion we take our meal,
which is always served on the Emperor's china,
in an illusion of summer.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The sky of Pekin is subject to excessive and
sudden variations of which we with our regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
climate can form no conception. Toward the
middle of the day, when I find myself out of
doors again under the cedars of the Yellow City,
the sun has suddenly disappeared behind some
leaden clouds which seem heavy with snow; the
Mongolian wind begins to blow, bitter cold, as it
was yesterday, and again a northern winter follows
with no transition stage a few hours of the
radiant weather of the <i>Midi</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have an arrangement to meet the members of
the French legation in the woods, to explore with
them the sepulchral Violet City, which is the
centre, the heart, the mystery of China, the veritable
abode of the Son of Heaven, the enormous
Sardanapalian citadel, in comparison with which
all the small modern palaces in the Imperial City
where we are living seem but children's playthings.</p>

<p>Even since the flight it has not been easy to
enter the Violet City with its yellow enamelled
roofs. Behind the double walls, mandarins and
eunuchs still dwell in this home of magnificence
and oppression, and it is said that a few women,
hidden princesses, and treasures still remain. The
two gates are guarded by severe sentries,&mdash;the
north gate by the Japanese, the south by
Americans.</p>

<p>It is by the first of these two entrances that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
are authorized to pass to-day, and the group of
small Japanese soldiers that we find there smile
upon us in welcome; but the austere gate&mdash;dark
red with gilded locks and hinges, representing the
heads of monsters&mdash;is closed from within and
resists their efforts. The use of centuries has
warped the enormous doors so that through the
crack one can see boards fastened on to the inside
to prevent their opening, and persons running
about announcing in flute-like voices that they
have received no orders.</p>

<p>We threaten to burn the doors, to climb over
them, to shoot through the opening; all sorts of
things which we have no intention of doing, but
which frighten the eunuchs and put them to flight.</p>

<p>No one is left to answer us. What are we to
do? We are freezing our feet by this cold wall;
the moat, full of dead reeds, exhales dampness,
and the wind continues to blow.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The kindly Japanese, however, send some of
their strongest men&mdash;who depart on a keen run&mdash;to
the other gate, some four kilometres around.
They light a fire for us out of cedar branches and
painted woodwork, where we take turns warming
our hands while we wait; we amuse ourselves by
picking up here and there old feathered arrows
thrown by prince or emperor from the top of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
walls. After an hour's patient waiting, noise and
voices are heard behind the silent gate; it is our
envoy inside cuffing the eunuchs.</p>

<p>Suddenly the boards creak and fall and the
doors open wide before us.</p>


<h3>III<br />
THE ABANDONED ROOM</h3>

<p>There is a faint odor of tea in the dark room,
an odor of I know not what beside,&mdash;of dried
flowers and old silks.</p>

<p>There is no way of getting more light in this
curious room, which opens into a big gloomy
salon, for its windows receive only half-light because
of the rice paper in all the panes; they open
onto a yard that is no doubt surrounded by triple
walls. The alcove-bed, large and low, which
seems to be set into an inner wall thick as a
rampart, has silk curtains and a cover of dark
blue,&mdash;the color of the sky at night. There are
no seats, indeed there would scarcely be room for
any; neither are there any books, nor could one
very well see to read. On the dark wooden chests
which serve as tables, stand melancholy bibelots in
glass cases; small vases of bronze or of jade containing
very stiff artificial bouquets, with petals
made of mother-of-pearl and ivory. A thick layer
of dust over everything shows that the room is
not occupied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption"><p><i>Copyright, 1901, by J. C. Hemment</i><br />
<span class="smcap">The Big Tower or Wall Entrance of Tartar City</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>At first sight there is nothing to mark the place
or the time,&mdash;unless, possibly, the fineness of the
ebony carving of the upper part of the bed reveals
the patience of the Chinese. Everything is sombre
and gloomy, with straight, austere lines.</p>

<p>Where are we, then, in what obscure, closed,
clandestine dwelling?</p>

<p>Has some one lived here in our time or was it
in the distant past?</p>

<p>How many hours&mdash;or how many centuries&mdash;has
he been gone, and who could he have been,
the occupant of the abandoned room?</p>

<p>Some sad dreamer evidently, to have chosen
this shadowy retreat; some one very refined, to
have left behind him this distinguished fragrance,
and very weary, to have been pleased with this
dull simplicity and this eternal twilight.</p>

<p>One feels stifled by the smallness of the windows,
whose panes are veiled with silky paper,
and which never can be opened to admit light or
air because they are sealed into the wall. And
besides, you recall the weary way you must take
to get here, and the obstacles you encounter, and
that disturbs you.</p>

<p>First, there is the big black Babylonian wall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the superhuman ramparts of a city more than ten
leagues around, which to-day is a mass of ruins,
half empty, and strewn with corpses; then a
second wall, painted blood-red, which forms a
second city enclosed in the first. Then a third
wall, more magnificent still, and also the color of
blood; this is the wall that surrounds the great
mysteries of the place, and before the days of
the war and the fall of the city no European had
ever gone beyond it; to-day we were detained
for more than an hour, in spite of passes, signed
and countersigned; through the keyhole of a
great gate guarded by soldiers and barricaded
from within, we were compelled to threaten and
argue at length with the guards inside, who sought
to hide and to escape. These gates once opened,
another wall appeared, separated from the former
one by a road going all the way around the enclosure;
here tattered garments were scattered
about, and dogs were playing with the bones of
the dead. This wall was of the same red, but still
more splendid, and was crowned along its entire
length by a horned ornamentation and by monsters
made of a golden yellow faience. When we
had finally passed this third wall, queer old beardless
persons came to meet us with distrustful greetings,
and guided us through a maze of little courts
and small gardens, walled and walled again, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
which old trees were growing amongst rockwork
and jars. All of it was separate, concealed, distressing;
all of it protected and peopled by monsters
and chimæras in bronze or marble, by a
thousand faces, whose grimaces signified ferocity
and hatred, by a thousand unknown symbols.
And every time each gate in the red walls with
the yellow faience tops closed behind us, as in
horrible dreams the doors of a series of passageways
close upon one, nevermore to permit one to
go out.</p>

<p>Now, after our long journey which seems like
a nightmare, we feel, as we look at the anxious
group who have conducted us, walking noiselessly
on their paper soles, that we have committed some
supreme and unheard-of profanation in their eyes,
in penetrating to this modest room; they stand
there in the doorway, peering obliquely at our
every gesture; the crafty eunuchs in silken robes,
and the thin mandarins, wearing along with the
red button of their headdresses, the melancholy
raven's quill. They were compelled to yield, they
did not wish to; they tried by every ruse to lead
us to some other part of the immense labyrinth of
this palace of Heliogabalus; to interest us in the
luxurious salons farther on, in the great courts,
and in the marble balconies, which we shall see
later; in a whole Versailles some distance farther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
on, now overgrown by weeds, and where no sound
is heard but the song of the crows.</p>

<p>They were determined we should not come here,
and it was by observing the dilation of the pupils
of their frightened eyes that we guessed which
way to go.</p>

<p>Who lived here, then, sequestered behind so
many walls,&mdash;walls more terrible by far than
those of our western prisons? Who could he
have been, the man who slept in this bed under
these silken covers of nocturnal blue, and in his
times of revery, at nightfall or at dawn, on glacial
winter days, was obliged to contemplate these pensive
little bouquets under glass, ranged so symmetrically
along the black chests?</p>

<p>It was he, the invisible Emperor, Son of
Heaven, childish and feeble; he whose empire
is vaster than all Europe, and who reigns like a
vague phantom over four or five hundred millions
of subjects.</p>

<p>It is the same person in whose veins the vigor
of half-deified ancestors is exhausted, who has too
long remained inactive, concealed in this palace
more sacred than a temple; the same who neglects
and envelops in twilight the diminishing place
where he is pleased to live. The immense setting
in which former emperors lived frightens him and
he abandons it all; grass and brushwood grow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
on the majestic marble railings and in the grand
courtyards; crows and pigeons by the hundreds
make their nests in the gilded vaults of the throne
room, covering with dirt and dung the rich and
curious rugs left there to be ruined. This inviolable
palace, a league in circumference, which no
foreigner has ever seen, of which one can learn
nothing, guess nothing, has in store for Europeans
who enter it for the first time the surprise
of mournful dilapidation and the silence of a tomb.</p>

<p>The pale Emperor never occupied the throne
rooms. No, what suited him was the quarter
where the small gardens were, and the enclosed
yards, the quaint quarter where the eunuchs tried
to prevent our going. The alcove-bed in its deep
recess, with its curtains like the blue of night, indicates
fear.</p>

<p>The small private apartments behind this
gloomy chamber extend like subterranean passages
into still deeper shadows; ebony is the prevailing
wood; everything is intentionally sombre,
even the mournful mummified bouquets under
their glass cases. There is a soft-toned piano
which the young Emperor was learning to play,
in spite of his long, brittle nails; a harmonium,
and a big music-box that gives Chinese airs with
a tone that seems to come from beneath the waters
of a lake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>Beyond this comes what was doubtless his most
cherished retreat,&mdash;it is narrow and low like the
cabin of a ship, and exhales the fine odor of tea
and dried rose-leaves.</p>

<p>There, in front of a small airhole covered with
rice paper, through which filters a little sombre
light, lies a mattress, covered with imperial golden-yellow
silk, which seems to retain the imprint of
a body habitually extended upon it. A few books,
a few private papers, are scattered about. Fastened
to the wall are two or three unimportant
pictures, not even framed, representing colorless
roses, and written in Chinese characters underneath
are the last orders of the physician for this
chronic invalid.</p>

<p>What was the real character of this dreamer,
who shall ever say? What distorted views of
life had been bequeathed to him of the things of
this world and of the world beyond? What do
all these gruesome symbols signify to him? The
emperors, the demigods, from whom he descends,
made old Asia tremble; tributary sovereigns came
from great distances to prostrate themselves, filling
this place with banners and processions more
magnificent than our imaginations can picture;
within these same walls, so silent to-day, how and
under what passing phantasmagoric aspects did
he retain the stamp of the wonderful past?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>And what confusion must have entered his unfathomable
little brain when the unprecedented act
was accomplished, and events occurred which he
never in his wildest fears could have anticipated!
His palace, with its triple walls, violated to its
most secret recesses; he, the Son of Heaven, torn
from the dwelling where twenty generations of
his ancestors had lived inaccessible; obliged to
flee, and in his flight to permit himself to be
seen, to act in the light of day like other men,
perhaps even to implore and to wait!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Just as we are leaving the abandoned room
our orderlies, who purposely remained behind,
laughingly throw themselves on the bed with the
nocturnal blue curtains, and I hear one of them
remark gaily in an aside and with a Gascon accent:
"Now, old fellow, we can say that we have
lain on the bed of the Emperor of China."</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Monday</span>, October 22.<br />
</div>

<p>Chinese workmen,&mdash;amongst whom we are
warned that there are spies and Boxers,&mdash;who
look after the fires in the two furnaces in our
palace, have kept us almost too warm all night.
When we get up there is, as there was yesterday,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
another illusion of summer on our light verandah
with the green columns painted with pink lotus
flowers. An almost burning sun is rising and
shining upon the ghostly pilgrimage which I am
about to make on horseback, toward the west, outside
the Tartar City, and through the ashy, silent,
ruined suburbs.</p>

<p>In this direction there were, scattered through
the dusty country, Christian cemeteries which even
in 1860 had never been violated by the yellow
race. But this time they furiously attacked the
dead, and left chaos and abomination behind them.
The oldest remains, those of missionaries who had
been sleeping there for three centuries, were disinterred,
crushed, piled up and set on fire in order
to destroy, according to Chinese beliefs, whatever
might still be left of their souls. One must be
somewhat acquainted with the ideas of the country
in order to understand the enormity of this supreme
insult to all our Occidental races.</p>

<p>The cemetery of the Jesuit Fathers was singularly
splendid. They were formerly very powerful
with the Celestial Emperors, and borrowed for
their own tombs the funereal emblems of the princes
of China. The ground is literally strewn now
with big marble dragons and tortoises, and with
tall stele with chimæras coiled about them; all
these carvings have been thrown down and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
smashed; the heavy stones of the vaults have
been broken also, and the ground thoroughly
overturned.</p>

<p>A more modest enclosure, not far away, has
for a long time been the burial-place for the European
legations. It has undergone the same treatment
as the beautiful cemetery of the Jesuits. The
Chinese have ransacked the graves, destroyed the
bodies, and even violated the coffins of little children.
Some few human bones are still lying on
the ground, while the crosses that marked the
graves are placed upside down. It is one of the
most poignantly affecting sights that ever met my
eyes.</p>

<p>Some good Sisters who lived near by kept a
school for Chinese children; of their houses
nothing is left but a pile of bricks and ashes, even
the trees have been uprooted and stuck back in the
ground head foremost.</p>

<p>This is their story:&mdash;</p>

<p>They were alone one night when about a thousand
Boxers came along, shouting their death cries
and playing gongs. The Sisters began to pray in
their chapel as they awaited death. However, the
noise died away, and when day broke no one was
in sight, so they escaped to Pekin and took shelter
with the bishop, taking their frightened little
pupils with them. When the Boxers were asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
later why they had not entered and killed the
Sisters, they replied: "Because we saw soldiers'
heads and guns all around the convent walls." So
the Sisters owed their lives to this hallucination
of their executioners.</p>

<p>The wells in the deserted gardens fill the air
to-day with odors of the dead. There were three
large cisterns which furnished a water so pure
that they sent all the way from the legations to get
it. The Boxers filled these wells up to the brim
with the mutilated bodies of little boys from the
Brothers' school and from Christian families in
the neighborhood. Dogs came to eat from the
horrible pile which came up to the level of the
ground; but they had their fill, and so the bodies
were left, and have been so preserved by the cold
and dryness that the marks of torture upon them
may still be seen. One poor thigh has been slashed
in stripes after the manner in which bakers sometimes
mark their loaves of bread, another poor
hand is without nails. And here is a woman from
whom one of the private parts of her body has
been cut and placed in her mouth, where it was left
by the dogs between her gaping jaws. The bodies
are covered with what looks like salt, but which
proves to be white frost, which in shady places
never melts here. Yet there is enough clear, implacable
sunshine to bring out the emaciation and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
to exaggerate the horrors of the open mouths, their
agonized expressions, and the rigidity of the anguished
positions of the dead.</p>

<p>There is not a cloud to-day, but a pale sky which
reflects a great deal of light. All winter, it seems,
it is much the same; even in the coldest weather
rains and snows are very exceptional in Pekin.</p>

<p>After our brief soldiers' breakfast, served on
rare china in the long gallery, I leave the Palace
of the North to install myself in the kiosk on the
opposite shore, which I selected yesterday, and to
begin my work. It is about two o'clock; a summer's
sun shines on my solitary path, on the whiteness
of the Marble Bridge, on the mud of the
Lake, and on the bodies that sleep amongst the
frosted lotus leaves.</p>

<p>The guards at the entrance to the Rotunda
Palace open and close behind me the red lacquered
doors. I mount the inclined plane leading to the
esplanade, and here I am alone, much alone, in the
silence of my lofty garden and my strange palace.</p>

<p>In order to reach my work-room, I have to go
along narrow passageways between old trees and
the most unnatural rockwork. The kiosk is
flooded with light, the beautiful sunshine falls on
my table and on my black seats with their cushions
of golden yellow; the beautiful melancholy October
sunshine illumines and warms my chosen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
retreat, where the Empress, it seems, loved to
come and sit and watch from this high point her
lake all pink with flowers.</p>

<p>The last butterflies and the last wasps, their
lives prolonged by this hot-house warmth, beat
their wings against the window-panes. The great
imperial lake is spread out before us, spanned by
the Marble Bridge; venerable trees form a girdle
around shores out of which rise the fanciful roofs
of palaces and pagodas,&mdash;roofs that are one marvellous
mass of faience. As in the landscapes
painted on Chinese fans, there are groups of tiny
rocks in the foreground, and small enamelled monsters
from a neighboring kiosk, while in the middle
distance there are knotted branches which have
fallen from some old cedar.</p>

<p>I am alone, entirely and deliciously alone, high
up in an inaccessible spot whose approaches are
guarded by sentinels. There is the occasional cry
of a crow or the gallop of a horse down below, at
the foot of the rampart whereon my frail habitation
rests, or the passing of an occasional messenger.
Otherwise nothing; not a single sound
near enough to trouble the sunny quiet of my
retreat. No surprise is possible, no visitor.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have been working for an hour, when a light
rustling behind me from the direction of the entrance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
gives me the feeling of some discreet and
agreeable presence. I turn round, and there is a
cat who has stopped short with one foot in the air,
hesitating and looking me straight in the eye, as
if to ask: "Who are you, and what are you doing
here?"</p>

<p>I call him quietly, he replies with a plaintive
miaul; and I, always tactful with cats, go on with
my writing, knowing very well that in a first interview
one must not be too insistent.</p>

<p>He is a very pretty cat, yellow and white,
with the distinguished and elegant air of a grand
seignior. A moment later and he is rubbing against
my leg; so then I put my hand slowly down on the
small, velvety head, which, after a sudden start,
permits my caresses and abandons itself to them.
It is over; the acquaintance is made. He is evidently
a cat accustomed to petting, probably an
intimate of the Empress. To-morrow and every
day I shall beg my orderly to bring him a cold
luncheon from my rations.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The illusion of summer ends with the day. The
sun sets big and red behind the Lake of the
Lotus, all at once taking on a sad, wintry look; at
the same time a chill comes over all things, and
the empty palace grows suddenly gloomy. For the
first time that day I hear footsteps approaching,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
resounding in the silence on the pavement of the
esplanade. My servants, Osman and Renaud, are
coming for me according to instructions; they are
the only human beings for whom the gate of the
walls below has orders to open.</p>

<p>It is icy cold as we cross the Marble Bridge in
the twilight to return to our home, and the moisture
is gathering in clouds over the lake, as it does
every night.</p>

<p>After supper we go on a man hunt in the dark,
through the courts and rooms of the place. On
the preceding nights we had observed through the
transparent window-panes disturbing little lights
which were promptly extinguished if we made any
noise. These lights moved up and down the uninhabited
galleries, some distance away, like fireflies.
To-night's effort brings about the capture
of three unknown men who with cutlasses and
dark lanterns have climbed over the walls to pilfer
in the imperial reserves. There are two Chinese
and one European, a soldier of one of the allied
nations. Not to make too much ado over it, we
content ourselves with putting them out after cudgelling
them well and boxing their ears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>


<h3>V</h3>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Tuesday</span>, October 23.<br />
</div>

<p>Last night there was a still harder frost, which
covered the ground in the courtyard with small
white crystals. This we discover during our regular
morning exploration of the galleries and dependencies
of the palace.</p>

<p>The former lodgings of the begging missionaries
and the schoolrooms are overflowing with packing
boxes containing reserve supplies of silk and
tea. There is also a heap of old bronzes, vases,
and incense-burners piled up to the height of a
man.</p>

<p>But the church itself is the most extraordinary
mine,&mdash;a regular Ali Baba's cave, quite filled. In
addition to antiquities brought from the Violet
City, the Empress had put there all the presents
she received two years ago for her Jubilee. (And
the line of mandarins who on that occasion brought
presents to their sovereign was a league long and
lasted an entire day.)</p>

<p>In the nave and side aisles the boxes and cases
are piled to half the height of the columns. In
spite of the confusion, in spite of the hasty pillaging
of those who have preceded us,&mdash;Chinese,
Japanese, German, and Russian soldiers,&mdash;a marvellous
collection remains. The most enormous of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
the chests,&mdash;those beneath,&mdash;protected by their
weight and by the mass of things on top of them,
have not even been opened. The first to go were
the innumerable smaller articles on top, most of
them enclosed in glass cases or in yellow silk coverings,
such as bunches of artificial flowers in agate,
jade, coral, or lapis lazuli, pagodas and blue landscapes
made of the feathers of the kingfisher marvellously
utilized. Works of Chinese patience
which have cost years of toil are now broken in
bits by the stroke of a bayonet, while the glass
which protected them is crackling under one's feet
on the floor.</p>

<p>Imperial robes of heavy silk brocaded with gold
dragons lie on the ground among cases of every
description. We walk over them, we walk over
carved ivories, over pearls and embroideries galore.
There are bronzes a thousand years old, from the
Empress's collection; there are screens which seem
to have been carved and embroidered by supernatural
beings, there are antique vases, cloisonné,
crackle ware, lacquers. Certain of the boxes underneath,
bearing the names of emperors who died
a century ago, contain presents sent them from
distant provinces, which no one has ever taken the
trouble to open. The sacristy of this astonishing
cathedral contains in a series of pasteboard boxes,
all the sumptuous costumes for the actors in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Empress's theatre, with many fashionable headdresses
of former times.</p>

<p>This church, so full of pagan riches, has kept
its organ intact, although it has been silent for
thirty years. My comrade mounts with me to the
gallery to try the effect of some hymns of Bach
and Händel under these vaultings, while the African
chasseurs, up to their knees in ivories, silks,
and court costumes, continue their task of clearing
things out below.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>About ten o'clock this morning I cross over to
the opposite side of the Violet City to visit the
Palace of Ancestors, which is in charge of our
marines. This was the Holy of Holies, the Pantheon
of dead emperors, a temple which was never
even approached.</p>

<p>It is in a particularly shady spot; in front of
the entrance gate are light but ornate triumphal
arches of green, red, and gold lacquer, resting on
frail supports, and mingling with the sombre
branches of the trees. Enormous cedars and cypresses,
twisted by age, shelter the marble monsters
which crouch at the threshold and have given them
a greenish hue.</p>

<p>Passing the first enclosure, we naturally find a
second. The courts, always shaded by old trees,
succeed one another in solemn magnificence. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
are paved with large stones, between which grows
a weed common in cemeteries; each one of the
cedars and cypresses which cast its shadow here
is surrounded by a marble circle and seems to
spring from a bed of carving. A thick layer of
thousands of pine needles continually falling from
the branches, covers everything. Gigantic incense-burners
of dull bronze, centuries old, rest on pedestals
bearing emblems of death.</p>

<p>Everything here has an unprecedented stamp of
antiquity and mystery. It is a unique place,
haunted by the ghosts of the Chinese emperors.</p>

<p>On each side are secondary temples, whose walls
of lacquer and gold have taken on with time the
shades of old Cordova leather. They contain
broken catafalques, emblems and objects pertaining
to certain funeral rites.</p>

<p>It is all incomprehensible and terrible; one feels
profoundly incapable of grasping the meaning of
these forms and symbols.</p>

<p>At length, in the last court on a white marble
terrace guarded by bronze roes, the Ancestors'
Palace lifts its tarnished gold façade, surmounted
by a roof of yellow lacquer.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It consists of one immense room, grand and
gloomy, all in faded gold turning to coppery red.
At the rear is a row of nine mysterious double<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
doors, which are sealed with wax. In the centre
are the tables on which the repasts for the ancestral
shades were placed, and where, on the day the
Yellow City was taken, our hungry soldiers rejoiced
to find an unexpected meal set forth. At
each extremity of this lofty room chimes and
stringed instruments await the hour, which may
never come again, when they shall make music
for the Shades. There are long, horizontal
zithers, grave in tone, which are supported by
golden monsters with closed eyes; gigantic
chimes, one of bells, the others of marble slabs
and jade, suspended by gold chains and surmounted
by great fantastic beasts spreading their
golden wings toward the dusky gold ceiling.</p>

<p>There are also lacquered cupboards as big as
houses, containing collections of old paintings,
rolled on ebony or ivory sticks, and wrapped in
imperial silks.</p>

<p>Some of these are marvellous, and are a revelation
of Chinese art of which we of the Occident
have no conception,&mdash;an art at least equal to
our own, though profoundly unlike it. Portraits
of emperors in silent revery, or hunting in the
forest, portray wild places which give one a longing
for primitive nature, for the unspoiled world
of rocks and trees. Portraits of dead empresses
painted in water-colors on faded silks recall the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
candid grace of the Italian Primitives,&mdash;portraits
so pale, so colorless, as to seem like fleeting
reflections of persons, yet showing a perfection
of modelling attained with absolute simplicity,
and with a look of concentration in the eye that
makes you feel the likeness and enables you for
one strange moment to live face to face with these
princesses of the past who have slept for centuries
in this splendid mausoleum. All these paintings
were sacred, never seen or even suspected to exist
by Europeans.</p>

<p>Other rolls, which when spread out on the
pavement are six or eight metres long, represent
processions, receptions at court, or lines of ambassadors;
cavaliers, armies, banners; men of all
kinds by the thousands, whose dress, embroideries,
and arms, suggest that one should look at
them with a magnifying glass. The whole history
of Chinese costume and ceremonial is contained
in these precious miniatures. We even find
here the reception, by I know not what emperor,
of an ambassador from Louis XIV.; small persons
with very French faces are represented as
though for exhibition at Versailles, with wigs
after the fashion of Roi-Soleil.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The nine magnificent sealed doors at the back
of the temple, shut off the altars of nine emperors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
They were good enough to break the red wax
seals for me and to destroy the fastenings at one
of the forbidden entrances, so that I might penetrate
into one of the sacred sanctuaries,&mdash;that of
the great Emperor Kouang-Lu, who was in his
glory at the beginning of the eighteenth century.
A serjeant has orders to accompany me in this
profanation, holding in his hand a lighted candle,
which seems to burn reluctantly here in the light
cold air of the tomb. The temple itself was quite
dark, but here it was black night itself, and it
seemed as though dirt and cinders had been thrown
about; the dust that accumulates so endlessly in
Pekin seems a sign of death and decay. Passing
from daylight, however dim, to the light of one
small candle that is lost in the shadows, one sees
confusedly at first, and there is a momentary hesitation,
especially if the place is startling in itself. I
see before me a staircase rising to a sort of tabernacle,
which seems to be full of artistic creations
of some unknown kind.</p>

<p>At both right and left, closed by complicated
locks, are some severe chests which I am permitted
to examine. In their compartments and
in their double secret bottoms the sovereign's imperial
seals have been concealed by the hundreds,&mdash;heavy
seals of onyx, jade, or gold struck off
for every occasion of his life and in commemoration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of all the acts of his reign; priceless relics
which no one dared touch after his obsequies, and
which have lain there for twice one hundred years.</p>

<p>I go up into the tabernacle and the serjeant
holds his candle before the marvels there,&mdash;jade
sceptres and vases, some of a peculiar and exquisite
workmanship in both dark and light jade,
in cloisonné on gold, or in plain solid gold. Behind
the altar in an obscure position a grand figure
which I had not perceived followed me with
an oblique look that reached me through two curtains
of yellow imperial silk, whose folds were
black with dust. It is a pale portrait of the defunct
Emperor,&mdash;a life-sized portrait, so obscure,
as seen by the light of our single wretched candle,
as to seem like the reflection of a ghost in a tarnished
mirror. What a nameless sacrilege would
our opening the chests where his treasures were
hidden seem to this dead man, nay, even our presence
in this most impenetrable of all places in an
impenetrable city!</p>

<p>When everything is carefully closed again, when
the red seals have been put back in place and the
pale image of the Emperor returned to silence, to
its customary shadows, I hasten to get away from
the tomblike chill, to breathe the air again, to seek
on the terrace some of the autumn sunshine which
filters through the cedar branches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>I am going to take breakfast to-day with the
French officers at the extreme north end of the
imperial wood, at the Temple of the Silkworm.
This, too, is an admirable old sanctuary, preceded
by sumptuous courts with marble terraces and
bronze vases. This Yellow City is a complete
world of temples and palaces set in green. Up
to last month the travellers who thought they
were seeing China, and to whom all this remained
closed, forbidden, could have no idea of the marvellous
city opened to us by the war.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When I start back to my Palace of the Rotunda,
about two o'clock, a burning sun is shining
on the dark cedars and willows; one seeks
shade as if it were summer, and the willows are
losing many of their leaves. At the entrance to
the Marble Bridge, not far from my gate, the two
bodies in blue gowns which lie among the lotus
are bathed in an ironical splendor of light.</p>

<p>After the soldiers on guard have closed the low
postern by which one gains access to my high
garden, I am again alone in the silence until the
sun's rays, falling oblique and red upon my writing-table,
announce the coming of the melancholy
evening.</p>

<p>I am scarcely seated at my work before a
friendly head, discreetly rubbed against my leg to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
attract my attention, announces the visit of the
cat. I am not unprepared for this visit, for I
now expect it every day.</p>

<p>An hour of ideal quiet goes by, broken only
by two or three ravens' cries. Then I hear the
noise of cavalry galloping over the stone pavements
at the foot of my wall; it proves to be
Field-Marshal von Waldersee, followed by an
escort of soldiers with small flags at the tips of
their spears. He is returning to the palace where
he lives, not far from here, one of the most sumptuous
of all the residences of the Empress. My
eyes follow the cavalcade as it crosses the Marble
Bridge, turns to the left, and is lost behind the
trees. Then the silence returns, absolute as before.</p>

<p>From time to time I go out to walk on my high
terrace, and always discover there something new.
There are enormous tam-tams under my cedars,
with which to call upon the gods; there are beds
of yellow chrysanthemums and Indian-yellow
carnations, upon which the frost has left a few
flowers; there is a kind of daïs of marble and
faience supporting an object quite indefinite at
first sight,&mdash;one of the largest blocks of jade in
the world, cut in imitation of an ocean wave with
monsters struggling in the foam.</p>

<p>I visit some deserted kiosks,&mdash;still furnished
with ebony thrones, divans, and yellow silk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
cushions,&mdash;which seem like little clandestine love
nests. There is no doubt that the beautiful sovereign,
passionate still, though aging, used to
isolate herself here with her favorites among the
imperial silks in these protecting shadows.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>My only companion in my palace of dreams
to-day is the big alabaster goddess robed in gold,
who perpetually smiles upon broken vases and
withered flowers; her temple, where the sun
never enters, is always cold and grows dark before
it should.</p>

<p>But now real night has come, and I begin to
feel chilly. The sun, which in France is at its
meridional apogee, is sinking; sinking here, a big
red ball without light or heat, going down behind
the Lake of the Lotus in a wintry mist.</p>

<p>The chill of the night comes on suddenly, giving
me the sensation of an abrupt descent into a
cave of ice and a furtive little feeling of anguish
at being exiled so far from home.</p>

<p>I greet my two servants like friends when they
come for me, bringing a cape for me to wear on
the way back to the palace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Wednesday</span>, October 24.<br />
</div>

<p>The same glorious sunshine in gallery, garden,
and wood. Each day the work of our soldiers
with their gangs of Chinese laborers goes on in
the nave of the Cathedral; they carefully separate
such treasures as have remained intact, or nearly
so, from what is irreparably injured. There is a
continual coming and going across our court of
furniture and precious bronzes in hand-barrows;
all that is taken out of the church is put in places
not at present needed for our troops, to await its
final transportation to the Ancestors' Palace, where
it is to remain under lock and key.</p>

<p>We have seen so many of these magnificent
things that we are satiated and worn with them.
The most remarkable discoveries made from the
depths of the oldest cases have ceased to astonish
us; there is nothing now that we want for the
decoration&mdash;oh, so fleeting&mdash;of our apartments;
nothing is sufficiently beautiful for our Heliogabalean
fancies. There will be no to-morrow, for the
inventory must be finished within a few days, and
then our long galleries will be parcelled out for
officers' rooms and offices.</p>

<p>In the way of discoveries, we came this morning
upon a pile of bodies,&mdash;the last defenders of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
the Imperial City, who fell all in a heap and
have remained in positions indicative of extreme
agony. The crows and the dogs have gone down
into the ditch where they lie and have devoured
eyes, chests, and intestines; there is no flesh left
on their bones, and their red spinal columns show
through their ragged raiment. Shoes are left, but
no hair; Chinamen have evidently descended into
the deep hole with the dogs and the crows, and
have scalped the dead in order to make false
queues.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To-day I leave the Palace of the North early
and for all day, as I must go over to the European
quarter to see our Minister at the Spanish
legation, where he was taken in; he is still in
bed, but convalescing so that at last I can make to
him the communications which I undertook on behalf
of the admiral.</p>

<p>For four days I have not been outside the red
walls of the Imperial City, have not left our superb
solitude. So when I find myself once more among
the ugly gray ruins of the commonplace streets of
the Tartar City, in everybody's Pekin, in the Pekin
known to all travellers, I appreciate better the
unique peculiarities of our great wood, of our lake,
and of all our forbidden glories.</p>

<p>However, this city of the people seems less forlorn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
than on the day of my arrival in the wind
and snow. The people are beginning to return,
as I have been told; Pekin is being repopulated,
the shops are opening, houses are rebuilding, and
already a few humble and entertaining trades have
been taken up along the streets, on tables, under
tents, and under parasols. The warm sunshine of
the Chinese autumn is the friend of many a poor
wretch who has no fire.</p>


<h3>VII<br />
THE TEMPLE OF THE LAMAS</h3>

<p>The Temple of the Lamas, the oldest sanctuary in
Pekin, and one of the most curious in the world,
contains a profusion of marvellous work of the
old Chinese gold and silver smiths, and a library
of inestimable value.</p>

<p>This precious temple has seldom been seen, although
it has been in existence for centuries.
Before this year's European invasion, access to it
was strictly forbidden to "outside barbarians,"
and even since the Allies have had possession of
Pekin, very few have ever gone there. It is protected
by its location in an angle of the Tartar wall
in quite a lifeless part of the city whose different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
quarters are dying from century to century as old
trees lose their branches one by one.</p>

<p>Going there to-day on a pilgrimage with the
members of the French legation, we find that we
are all there for the first time.</p>

<p>In order to reach it we first cross the eastern
market-place, three or four kilometres through a
sunless and desolate Pekin,&mdash;a Pekin that bears
the marks of war and defeat, and where things are
spread out for sale on the filth and ashes of the
ground. Some matchless objects transmitted by
one generation of mandarins to another are to
be found among the rags and old iron; ancient
palaces, as well as the houses of the poor, have
emptied here some of their most astonishing contents;
the sordid and the marvellous lie side by
side,&mdash;here some pestilential rags, there a bibelot
three thousand years old. Along the walls of the
houses as far as one can see, the cast-off garments
of dead men and women are hung. It is a place
for the sale of extravagant clothing without end,
opulent furs from Mongolia stolen from the rich,
gay costumes of a courtesan, or magnificent heavy
silk robes which belonged to great ladies who have
disappeared. The Chinese populace, who have
done a hundred times more than the invaders
in the way of pillage, burning, and destruction in
Pekin, the uniformly dirty populace, dressed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
blue cotton, with squinting, evil eyes, swarm
and crawl about, eagerly searching and raising a
perfect cloud of microbes and dust. Ignoble
scoundrels with long queues circulate amongst the
crowd, offering robes of ermine or blue-fox, or
admirable sables for a few piasters, in their eagerness
to be rid of stolen goods.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As we approach the object of our journey it
grows more quiet; the busy, crowded streets are
gradually succeeded by streets that have perished
of old age, where there are no passers; grass
grows on the thresholds and behind abandoned
walls; we see trees with branches knotted like the
arms of the aged.</p>

<p>We dismount before a crumbling entrance which
seems to open into a park which might be a ghosts'
walk; and this is the entrance to the temple.</p>

<p>What sort of a reception shall we have in this
mysterious enclosure? We do not know; and at
first there is no one to receive us. But the chief
of the Lamas soon appears, bowing, with his keys,
and we follow him across the funereal park.</p>

<p>With a violet dress, a shaven head, and a face
like old wax, at once smiling, frightened, and hostile,
he conducts us to a second door, opening into
an immense court paved with white stones, completely
surrounded by the curious walls of the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
buildings of the temple. Their foundations are
massive, their roofs curved and forked, the walls
themselves awe-inspiring on account of their size,
and hermetically sealed; and all this is the color
of ochre and rust, with golden reflections thrown
on the high roofs by the evening sun.</p>

<p>The court is deserted, the grass grows between
the paving-stones. On the white marble balustrades
in front of the closed doors of these great
temples are ranged "prayer-mills," which are
conical thrones made of bronze, and engraved with
secret symbols, which the priests turn and turn
while murmuring words unintelligible to men of
our day.</p>

<p>In old Asia, which is our ancestor, I have penetrated
to the heart of ancient sanctuaries, trembling
meanwhile with indefinable anguish before
symbols whose meaning has been lost for centuries.
This kind of anguish has never been so tinged
with melancholy as to-night, standing before this
row of silent "prayer-mills" in the cold, the wind,
the solitude, the dilapidation of this court, with its
white grass-grown pavement and mysterious yellow
walls.</p>

<p>Young Lamas appear one after the other as
noiselessly as shadows, and even Lama children,
for they begin to instruct them quite young in the
old rites no longer understood by any one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>They are young, but they have no appearance of
youth; senility is upon them as well as a look of
I know not what of mystical dulness; their gaze
seems to have come from past centuries and to
have lost its clearness on the way. Whether from
poverty or renunciation, the yellow gowns that
cover their thin bodies are faded and torn. Their
faces and their dress, as well as their religion and
their sanctuary, are covered, so to speak, with the
ashes of time.</p>

<p>They are glad to show us all that we wish to
see in their old buildings; and we begin with the
study-rooms, where so many generations of obscure
and unprogressive priests have been slowly
formed.</p>

<p>By looking closely, it is plain that all these walls,
now the color of the oxydized metal, were once
covered with beautiful designs in lacquer and gilt;
to harmonize them all into the present old-bronze
shades has required an indefinite succession of
burning summers and glacial winters, together
with the dust,&mdash;the incessant dust blown across
Pekin from the deserts of Mongolia.</p>

<p>Their study-rooms are very dark,&mdash;anything
else would have surprised us; and this explains
why their eyes protrude so from their drooping lids.
Very dark these rooms are, but immense; sumptuous
still, in spite of their neglect, and conceived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
on a grand scale, as are all the monuments of this
city, which was in its day the most magnificent in
the world. The high ceilings are supported by
lacquered columns. There are small seats for the
students, and carved desks by the hundred, all
arranged in rows and worn and defaced by long
use. Gods in golden robes are seated in the corners.
The wall hangings of priceless old work
represent the joys of Nirvana. The libraries are
overflowing with old manuscripts, some in the
form of books, and others in great rolls wrapped
up in colored silks.</p>

<p>We are shown into the first temple, which, as
soon as the door is opened, shines with a golden
glow,&mdash;the glow of gold used discreetly, and with
the warm, reddish tones which lacquer takes on in
the course of centuries. There are three golden
altars, on which are enthroned in the midst of a
pleiad of small golden gods three great ones, with
downcast eyes. The straight stems of the gold
flowers standing in gold vases in front of the
altars are of archaic stiffness. The repetition, the
persistent multiplication of the same objects, attitudes,
and faces, is one of the characteristics of
the unchanging art of pagodas. As is the case
with all the temples of the past, there is here no
opening for the light; only the light that comes in
through the half-opened doors illumines from below<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the smile of the great seated idols, and shows
dimly the decorations of the ceiling. Nothing
has been touched, nothing taken away, not even
the admirable cloisonné vases where sticks of incense
are burning,&mdash;evidently this place has been
ignored.</p>

<p>Behind this temple, behind its dusty dependencies,
in which the tortures of the Buddhist hell
are depicted, the Lamas conduct us to a second
court, paved in white stones, similar in every way
to the first; the same dilapidation, the same solitude,
the same coppery-yellow walls.</p>

<p>After this second court comes another temple,
identical with the first, so much so that one wonders
if one is not the victim of an illusion; the
same figures, the same smiles, the same gold bouquets
in vases of gold,&mdash;a patient and servile
reproduction of the same magnificence.</p>

<p>After this second temple there is a third court,
and a third temple exactly like the two others.
But the sun is now lower, and lights only the extreme
tips of the faience roofs and the thousands
of small monsters of yellow enamel which seem
to be chasing one another over the tiling. The
wind increases, and we shiver with cold. The
pigeons in the carved cornice begin to seek their
nests, and the silent owls wake up and begin to
fly about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>As we expected, this last temple&mdash;possibly the
oldest, certainly the most dilapidated&mdash;is only a
repetition of the other two, save for an idol in the
centre, which, instead of being seated and life-sized,
is colossal and standing. The gold ceiling
rises from about half the height of the statue into
a cupola, also gilded, which forms a sort of box
enclosing the upper part of the figure. To see the
face one must go close to the altars and look up
between the rigid flowers and the incense-burners.
It then looks like a Titanic mummy in its case,
with a downcast look that makes one nervous. But
on looking steadily, it exercises a sort of spell;
one is hypnotized and held by that smile so impartially
bestowed upon all this entourage of dying
splendor, gold, dust, cold, twilight, ruins, silence.</p>


<h3>VIII<br />
CONFUCIUS</h3>

<p>There was still a half-hour of sunshine after we
left the ghostly Lamas, so we went to pay a call
on Confucius, who dwells in the same quarter,&mdash;the
same necropolis, one might say,&mdash;in an abandonment
equally depressing.</p>

<p>The big worm-eaten door slips off its hinges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
and falls down as we attempt to enter, and an owl
who was asleep there takes fright and flies away.
Behold us in a sort of mortuary wood, walking
over the brown autumn grass.</p>

<p>A triumphal arch is the first thing we come
across, built to pay homage to some great Chinese
thinker. It is of a charming design, although
very peculiar, with three little bell-towers of yellow
enamel, which crown the whole, their curved roofs
decorated with monsters at each one of the corners.</p>

<p>It stands there like some precious bibelot lost
among the ruins. Its freshness is surprising where
all else is so dilapidated. One realizes its great age
from the archaic nature of its details; but it is
made of such enduring materials that the wear and
tear of centuries in this dry climate has not affected
it. The base is white marble, the rest is of faience,&mdash;faience
both yellow and green, with lotus leaves,
clouds, and chimæras in bold relief.</p>

<p>Farther on is a large rotunda which gives evidence
of extreme antiquity; this appears to be the
color of dirt or ashes, and is surrounded by a moat
where the lotus and the reeds are dying. This is
a retreat where wise men may come to meditate
upon the vanities of life; the object of the moat
is to isolate it and make it more quiet.</p>

<p>It is reached by an arched bridge of marble,
with railings that vaguely suggest a succession of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
animals' heads. Inside, it is deserted, abandoned,
crumbling away, and the gold ceiling is full of
birds' nests. A really magnificent desk is left,
with an arm-chair and a table. It seems as though
a kind of fine clay had been scattered by handfuls
over everything; the ground is covered with it too,
so that one's feet sink into it and one's steps are
muffled. We soon discover that there is still a carpet
underneath, and that it is really nothing but
dust which has been accumulating for centuries,&mdash;the
thick and ever-present dust which the Mongolian
winds blow across Pekin.</p>

<p>After a short walk under the old trees we reach
the temple itself, which is preceded by a court
surrounded by tall marble pillars. This looks
exactly like a cemetery, and yet there are no dead
lying under these stele, which are there merely to
glorify the memory of the departed. Philosophers
who in bygone centuries made this region illustrious
by their presence and by their dreams, profound
thinkers, lost to us forever, have their names
as well as some few of their most transcendent
utterances, perpetuated on these stele.</p>

<p>On either side of the white steps leading to
the sanctuary, blocks of marble are arranged in the
form of a tam-tam. These are so old as to make
one's head swim; and upon them maxims intelligible
only to a few erudite mandarins have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
written in primitive Chinese characters, in letters
contemporary with and sisters to the hieroglyphs
of Egypt.</p>

<p>This is the temple of disinterestedness, of abstract
thought, and of cold speculation. One is
struck at once by its absolute simplicity, for which,
up to this point, nothing in China has prepared us.
Very large, very high as to ceilings, very grand
and of a uniform blood-red color, it is magnificently
empty and supremely quiet. The columns
and walls are red, with a few discreet decorations
in gold, dimmed by time and dust. In the centre is
a bouquet of gigantic lotus in a colossal vase, and
that is all. After the profusion, the debauch of
monsters and idols, the multiplication of human
and animal forms in the usual Chinese pagoda, this
absence of figures of any sort is a comfort and a
relief.</p>

<p>In the niches all along the wall there are stele,
red like the rest of the place, and consecrated to the
memory of persons still more eminent than those
of the entrance court, with quotations from their
writings carved upon them. The stele of Confucius
himself, which is larger than the others, and
has longer quotations, occupies the position of
honor in the centre of this severe Pantheon, and is
placed on a kind of altar.</p>

<p>Properly speaking, this is not a temple; it is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
a place for prayer or service. It is rather an
academy, a meeting-place for calm, philosophic
discussion. In spite of its dust and its abandoned
air, it seems that newly elected members of the
Academy of Pekin (which is even more than our
own the conservator of form and ceremony, I am
assured) are still bound to give a conference here.</p>

<p>Besides various maxims of renunciation and
wisdom written from top to bottom of the stele,
Confucius has left to this sanctuary certain
thoughts on literature which have been engraved
in letters of gold in such a way as to form pictures
hung on the walls.</p>

<p>Here is one which I transcribe for young
western scholars who are preoccupied with classification
and inquiry. They will find in it a reply
twice two thousand years old to one of their favorite
questions: "The literature of the future
will be the literature of compassion."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is almost five o'clock when the gloomy, red,
autumn sun goes down behind great China on
Europe's side, and we leave the temples and the
grove behind. I separate from my companions,
for they live in the legation quarter in the southern
part of the Tartar City, while I go to the Imperial
City, far from here.</p>

<p>I have no idea how to get out of this dead region,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
all new to me, where we have spent the day,
and through the lonely labyrinthine streets of
Pekin. I have as a guide a "mafou," who has
been lent to me, and I only know that I have more
than a mile to go before reaching my sumptuous,
deserted quarters.</p>

<p>My companions gone, I walk for a few moments
in the silent old uninhabited streets before reaching
one of the long, broad avenues where blue cotton
dresses and long-queued yellow faces begin to
appear. There is an interminable row of low
houses, wretched, gray things, on either side of
the street, where the tramp of horses raises the
black friable dust in infectious clouds.</p>

<p>The street is so wide and the houses so low
that almost the whole of the twilight sky is visible
above our heads; and so suddenly does the cold
come on after sunset that in a moment we freeze.</p>

<p>The crowds are dense about the food-shops,
and the air is fetid in the neighborhood of the
butchers, where dog-meat and roasted grasshoppers
are sold. But what good nature in all these
people of the streets, who on the day after battle
and bombardment permit me to pass without so
much as an evil look! What could I do, with my
borrowed "mafou" and my revolver, if my appearance
did not happen to please them?</p>

<p>For a time after this we are alone in desolate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
ruined quarters of the town. According to the
position of the pale, setting sun, it seems to me that
we are on the right track; but if my "mafou,"
who speaks nothing but Chinese, has not understood
me, I shall be in a predicament.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The return journey in the cold seems interminable
to me. At last, however, the artificial
mountain of the imperial park is silhouetted in
gray on the sky ahead of us, with the little faience
kiosks and the twisted trees grouping themselves
like scenes painted on lacquer. We reach one of
the yellow enamelled gates of the blood-red wall
surrounding the Imperial City, where two sentinels
of the allied armies present arms. From here
I know my way, I am at home; so I dismiss my
guide and proceed alone to the Yellow City, from
which at this hour no one is allowed to depart.</p>

<p>The Imperial, the Yellow, the Forbidden City,
encircled by its own terrible walls in the very heart
of great Pekin, with its Babylonian environment,
is a park rather than a city, a wood of venerable
trees,&mdash;sombre cypresses and cedars,&mdash;several
leagues in circumference. Some ancient temples
peep through the branches, and several modern
palaces built according to the fancies of the Empress
regent. This great forest, to which I return
to-night as if it were my home, has at no former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
period of history been known to foreigners; even
ambassadors have never passed its gates; until
recently it has been absolutely inaccessible and
profoundly unknown to Europeans.</p>

<p>This Yellow City surrounds and protects with
its tranquil shadows the still more mysterious
Violet City, the residence of the Son of Heaven,
which occupies a commanding square in the centre
of it, protected by moats and double ramparts.</p>

<p>What silence reigns here at this hour! What
a lugubrious region it is! Death hovers over these
paths where formerly princesses passed in their
palanquins and empresses with their silk-robed followers.
Now that the usual inhabitants have fled
and Occidental barbarians have taken their places,
one meets no one in the woods, unless it be an
occasional patrol or a few soldiers of one nation
or another, and only the sentinels' step is heard
before palace or temple, or the cries of the crows
and the barking of dogs about the dead.</p>

<p>I have to cross a region filled with trees, nothing
but trees,&mdash;trees of a truly Chinese contour,
whose aspect is in itself quite sufficient to give one
the sharp realization of exile; the road goes on
under the deep shadow of the branches that turn
the twilight into night. Belated magpies are hopping
about on the withered grass, and the crows,
too, their croakings exaggerated by the cold and
the silence. At the end of a quarter of an hour a
corner of the Violet City appears, just at a turn
of the road. She slowly reveals herself, silent,
closed, like a colossal tomb. Her long, straight
walls are lost in the confusion and obscurity of
the distance. As I draw nearer to her the silence
seems to be intensified, as though it grew as she
broods over it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>One corner of the Lake of the Lotus begins to
come out like a bit of mirror placed among the
reeds to receive the last reflections of the sky. I
must pass along its edges in front of the Island of
Jade, which is approached by a marble bridge; and
I know in advance, because I have seen it daily,
the horrible grimace in store for me from the
two monsters who have guarded the bridge for
centuries.</p>

<p>At length I emerge from the shadow and oppression
of the trees into open space with the
clear sky overhead, leaving the lake behind me.
The first stars are appearing, indicating another
of the nights that pass here in an excess of solitude
and silence, with only an occasional gunshot
to break the tragic calm of wood and palace.</p>

<p>The Lake of the Lotus, which during the season
of flowers must be the marvellous field of pink
blossoms described by the poets of China, is now,
at the end of October, only a melancholy swamp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
covered with brown leaves, from which at this
hour a wintry mist rises that hangs like a cloud
over the dead reeds.</p>

<p>My dwelling is on the other side of the lake;
and now I have reached the Marble Bridge which
spans it with a beautiful curve,&mdash;a curve that
stands out white in spite of the darkness.</p>

<p>At this point a corpse-like smell greets my nostrils.
For a week I have known whence it comes,&mdash;from
a person in a blue gown lying with outspread
arms, face downward, on the slimy shore;
and ten steps farther on his comrade is lying in
the grass.</p>

<p>As soon as I cross the beautiful lonely Marble
Bridge through the pale cloud that hangs over the
water I shall be almost home. At my left is a
faience gateway guarded by two German sentinels,&mdash;two
living beings whom I shall not be
sorry to see,&mdash;who will salute me in automatic
unison; this will be at the entrance to the garden
where Field-Marshal von Waldersee resides, in
one of the Empress's palaces.</p>

<p>Two hundred metres farther on, after passing
more gates and more ruins, I shall come to a fresh
opening in an old wall, which will be my entrance,
guarded by one of our own men,&mdash;an African
chasseur. Another of the Empress's palaces is
there concealed by its surroundings,&mdash;a frail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
palace, almost wholly enclosed in glass. Once
there, I push open a glass door decorated with
pink lotus flowers, and find again my nightly
fairyland, where priceless porcelains, cloisonné,
and lacquer stand about in profusion on the yellow
carpets under the wonderfully carved arches
of ebony.</p>


<h3>IX</h3>

<p>It is dark when I reach my dwelling-place. The
fires are already lighted in the subterranean furnaces,
and a soft heat rises through the thick yellow
carpets. We feel much at home and quite
comfortable now in this palace, which at first
seemed so dreary to us.</p>

<p>I dine, as usual, at a small ebony table, which
is lost in the long gallery so dark at either end,
in company with my comrade, Captain C., who
has discovered new and wonderful treasures during
the day, which he has spread out, that we
may enjoy them for at least an evening.</p>

<p>First, there is a throne of a style unknown to
us; some screens of colossal size that rest in ebony
sockets, on which shining birds are battling with
monkeys amid the flowers of a dream. Candelabra,
which have remained in their silk cases
since the seventeenth century, now hang from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
arches above our heads,&mdash;a shower of pearls and
enamel,&mdash;and many other indescribable things
added to-day to our wealth of articles of antique
art.</p>

<p>It is the last time we shall be able to enjoy our
gallery in its completeness, for to-morrow most
of these objects are to be labelled and sent off
with the reserve stock. Retaining one salon for
the general, who is to winter here, the rest of this
wing of the palace is to be cut up by light partitions
into lodgings and offices for the staff. This
work will be done under the direction of Captain
C., who is chief architect and supervisor, whilst
I, a passing guest, will have only a consulting
voice.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As this evening marks the last chapter of our
imperial phantasmagoria, we sit up later than
usual. For this once we are childish enough to
array ourselves in sumptuous Asiatic garments,
then we throw ourselves down on the cushions
and call opium&mdash;so favorable to weary and
blasé imaginations such as ours have unfortunately
begun to be&mdash;to our aid. Alas! to be
alone in this palace would have seemed magical
enough to us a few years ago without the aid of
any avatar.</p>

<p>The opium, needless to say, is of exquisite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
quality; its fumes, rising in rapid little spirals,
soon make the air sweet and heavy. It quickly
brings to us the ecstasy, the forgetfulness, the relief,
the youthful lightness so dear to the Chinese.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is absolute silence without; absolute silence
and deserted courts, where all is cold and
black. The gallery grows warm, the heat of the
furnace is heavy, for these walls of glass and
paper, so frail as a protection against surprises
from without, form rooms almost hermetically
sealed and propitious to the intoxication that
comes from perfumes.</p>

<p>Stretched out upon the silken cushions, we gaze
at the receding ceiling, at the row of arches so
elaborately carved into lacework, from which the
lanterns with the dangling pearls are suspended.
Chimæras of gold stand out from the thick folds
of the green or yellow silks. High screens of
cloisonné, lacquer, or ebony, the great luxury of
China, shut off the corners, forming luxurious
nooks filled with jars, bronzes, and monsters
with eyes of jade,&mdash;eyes which squintingly follow
you.</p>

<p>Absolute silence, except that from a distance
one of those shots is heard which never fails to
mark the torpor of the night, or a cry of distress
or alarm; skirmishes between Europeans in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
posts and thieving Chinamen; sentinels afraid of
the dead or of the night shooting at a shadow.</p>

<p>In the foreground, which is lighted by one lamp,
the only luminous things whose design and color
are engraved upon our already fixed gaze are four
gigantic incense-burners&mdash;hieratic in form, and
made of an adorable blue cloisonné&mdash;resting on
gold elephants. They stand out against a background
of black lacquer traversed by flying birds,
whose plumage is made of different kinds of
mother-of-pearl. No doubt our lamp is going
out, for, with the exception of these nearer things,
we scarcely see the magnificence of the place until
the outline of some rare vase five hundred years
old, the reflection of a piece of inimitable silk, or
the brilliancy of some bit of enamel recalls it to
our memory.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The fumes of the opium keep us awake until
very late, in a state of mind that is both lucid and
at the same time confused. We have never until
now understood Chinese art; it is revealed to us
for the first time to-night. In the beginning we
were ignorant, as is all the world, of its almost
terrible grandeur until we saw the Imperial City
and the walled palace of the Son of Heaven; now
at this nocturnal hour, amid the fragrant fumes
that rise in clouds in our over-heated gallery, our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
impressions of the big sombre temples, of the
yellow enamelled roofs crowning the Titanic buildings
that rise above terraces of marble, are exalted
above mere captivated admiration to respect and
awe.</p>

<p>In the thousand details of its embroidery and
carvings which surround us in such profusion,
we learn how skilful and how exact this art is
in rendering the grace of flowers, exaggerating
their superb and languishing poses and their
deep or deliciously pale colorings; then in order
to make clear the cruelty of every kind of living
thing, down to dragons and butterflies, they place
claws, horns, terrible smiles, and leering eyes upon
them! They are right; these embroideries on our
cushions <i>are</i> roses, lotus flowers, chrysanthemums!
As for the insects, the scarabs, the flies, and the
moths, they are just like those horrid things
painted in gold relief on our court fans.</p>

<p>When we arrive at that special form of physical
prostration which sets the mind free (disengages
the astral body, they say at Benares), everything
in the palace, as well as in the outside world,
seems easy and amusing. We congratulate ourselves
upon having come to live in the Yellow City
at so unique a period in the history of China, at a
moment when everything is free, and we are left
almost alone to gratify our whims and curiosity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Life seems to hold to-morrows filled with new and
interesting circumstances. In our conversation we
find words, formulas, images, to express the inexpressible,
the things that have never been said.
The hopelessness, the misery that one carries about
like the weight on a convict's leg, is incontestably
lessened; and as to the small annoyances of the
moment, the little pin-pricks, they exist no longer.
For example, when we see through the glass gallery
the pale light of a moving lantern in a distant
part of our palace, we say without the slightest
feeling of disturbance: "More thieves! They
must see us. We'll hunt them down to-morrow!"</p>

<p>And it seems of no consequence, even comfortable
to us, that our cushions and our imperial silks
are shut off from the cold and the horrors by nothing
but panes of glass.</p>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Thursday</span>, October 25.<br />
</div>

<p>I have worked all day, with only my cat for company,
in the solitude of the Rotunda Palace that
I deserted yesterday.</p>

<p>At the hour when the red sun is setting behind
the Lake of the Lotus my two servants come as
usual to get me. But this time, after crossing the
Marble Bridge, we pass the turn which leads to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
my palace, for I have to pay a visit to Monsignor
Favier, the Bishop of Pekin, who lives in our
vicinity, outside yet quite near the Imperial City.</p>

<p>It is twilight by the time we reach the "Catholic
Concession," where the missionaries and their
little band of yellow followers endured the stress
of a long siege. The cathedral, riddled with balls,
has a vague look against the dark sky; and it is
so dusty that we see as through a fog this newly
built cathedral, the one the Empress paid for in
place of the one she took for a storehouse.</p>

<p>Monsignor Favier, the head of the French missions,
has lived in Pekin for forty years, has enjoyed
for a long time the favor of the sovereigns,
and was the first to foresee and denounce the Boxer
peril. In spite of the temporary blow to his work,
he is still a power in China, where the title of
Viceroy was at one time conferred upon him.</p>

<p>The white-walled room where he receives me,
lately pierced by a cannon-ball, contains some
precious Chinese bibelots, whose presence here
astonishes every one at first. He collected them
in other days, and is selling them now in order
to be able to assist several thousand hungry people
driven by the war into his church.</p>

<p>The bishop is a tall man, with fine, regular
features, and eyes that show shrewdness and energy.
He must resemble in looks, as well as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
his determined will, those bishops of the Middle
Ages who went on Crusades to the Holy Land.
It is only since the outbreak of hostilities against
the Christians that he has resumed the priests'
cloth and cut off his long Chinese queue. Permission
to wear the queue and the Mandarins'
garb was one of the greatest and most subversive
favors accorded the Lazarists by the Celestial
emperors.</p>

<p>He was good enough to keep me with him for
an hour. A well-dressed Chinese served us with
tea while he told me of the recent tragedy; of the
defence of fourteen hundred metres of wall, organized
out of nothing by a young ensign and
thirty sailors, of their holding out for two or
three months right in the heart of an enflamed
city, against thousands of enemies wild with fury.
Although he tells it all in a very low tone, his
speech grows warmer, and vibrates with a sort of
soldierly ruggedness as some emotion chokes him,
especially whenever he mentions Ensign Henry.</p>

<p>Ensign Henry died, pierced by two balls, at the
end of the last great fight. Of his thirty sailors
many were killed, and almost all were wounded.
This story of a summer should be written somewhere
in letters of gold, lest it should be too quickly
forgotten; it should be attested, lest some day it
should no longer be believed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>The sailors under the command of this young
officer were not picked men; they were the first
that came, selected hap-hazard on board ship. A
few noble priests shared their vigils, a few brave
seminarists took a turn under their orders, besides
a horde of Chinese armed with miserable
old guns. But the sailors were the heart and
soul of this obstinate defence; there was neither
weakening nor complaint in the face of death,
which was at all times present in its most atrocious
forms.</p>

<p>An officer and ten Italian soldiers brought hither
by chance also fought heroically, leaving six of
their number among the dead.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Oh, the heroism, the lowly heroism of these
poor Chinese Christians, both Catholic and Protestant,
who sought protection in the bishop's
palace, knowing that one word of abjuration, one
reverence to a Buddhist image would ensure their
lives, yet who remained there, faithful, in spite of
gnawing hunger and almost certain martyrdom!
And at the same time, outside of these walls which
protected them in a measure, fifteen thousand of
their brothers were burned, dismembered, and
thrown piecemeal into the river on account of
the new faith which they would not renounce.</p>

<p>Unheard-of things happened during this siege:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
a bishop,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> followed by an ensign and four marines,
went to wrest a cannon from the enemy,
balls grazing their heads; theological students
manufactured powder from the charred branches
of the trees in the close, and from saltpetre, which
they scaled the walls to steal at night from a
Chinese arsenal.</p>

<p>They lived in a continual tumult under a continual
fire of stones and shot; all the marble bell-towers
of the cathedral, riddled by shells, tottered
and fell piecemeal upon their heads. At all hours,
without truce, bullets rained in the court, breaking
in the roofs and weakening the walls. At
night especially balls fell like hailstones to the
sound of the Boxers' trumpets and frightful gongs.
And all the while their death-cries, "Cha! Cha!"
(Let us kill, let us kill) or "Chao! Chao!" (Let
us burn, let us burn) filled the city like the cries
of an enormous pack of hounds.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was in July and August under a burning sky,
and they lived surrounded by fire; incendiaries
sprinkled their roofs and their entrances with petroleum
by means of pumps and threw lighted
torches onto them; they were obliged to run from
one place to another and to climb up with ladders
and wet blankets to put out the flames. They had
to run, run all the time, when they were so exhausted
and their heads so heavy from having had
no food, that they could scarcely stand.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>
<p>Even the good Sisters had to organize a kind
of race for the women and children, who were
stupefied from fear and suffering. It was these
sublime women who decided when it was necessary
to change positions according to the direction
from which the shells came and who chose
the least dangerous moment to fly, with bowed
heads, across a court, and to take refuge elsewhere.
A thousand women without wills or ideas
of their own, with poor dying babies clinging to
their breasts, followed them; a human eddy, advancing,
receding, pushing, in order to keep in
sight the white caps of their protectors.</p>

<p>They had to run when, from lack of food, they
could scarcely stand, and when a supreme lassitude
impelled them to lie down on the ground to await
death! They had to become accustomed to detonations
that never ceased, to perpetual noise, to
shot and shell, to the fall of stones, to seeing one
of their number fall bathed in his own blood!
Hunger was the most intolerable of all. They
made soup of the leaves and young branches of
the trees, of dahlia roots from the gardens and of
lily bulbs. The poor Chinese would say humbly,
"We must keep the little grain we have left for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
the sailors who are protecting us, and whose need
of strength is greater than ours."</p>

<p>The bishop told of a poor woman who had been
confined the previous night, who dragged herself
after him imploring: "Bishop, bishop, give me a
handful of grain so that my milk will come and
my child may not die!"</p>

<p>All night long the feeble voices of several hundred
children were heard in the church moaning
for lack of food. To use the expression of Monsignor
Favier, it was like "the bleatings of a flock
of lambs about to be sacrificed." But their cries
diminished, for they were buried at the rate of
fifteen in a single day.</p>

<p>They knew that not far away in the European
legations a similar drama was being enacted, but,
needless to say, there was no communication between
them; and if any young Chinese Christian
offered to go there with a message from the
bishop asking for help, or at least for news, it
was not long before they saw his head, with the
note pinned to his cheek, reappear above the wall
at the end of a rod garnished with his entrails.</p>

<p>Not only did bullets rain by the hundreds every
day, but the Boxers put anything that fell into
their furious hands into their cannon,&mdash;stones,
bricks, bits of iron, old kettles. The besieged had
no doctors; they hopelessly, and as best they could,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
bound up great horrible wounds, great holes in
the breast. The arms of the voluntary grave-diggers
were exhausted with digging places in
which to bury the dead, or parts of the dead. And
the cry of the infuriated mob went on, "Cha!
Cha!" (Let us kill, let us kill!) to the grim
sounds of their iron gongs and the blasts of their
trumpets.</p>

<p>Mines went off in different localities, swallowing
up people and bits of wall. In the gulf made
by one of them fifty little babies in their cradles
disappeared. Their sufferings at least were over.
Each time a new breach was made the Boxers
threw themselves upon it, and it became a yawning
opportunity for torture and death.</p>

<p>But Ensign Henry was always there; with such
of his sailors as had been spared he was seen rushing
to the place where he was needed, to the exact
spot where the most effective work could be done,&mdash;on
a roof or on the crest of a wall,&mdash;and they
killed and they killed, without losing a ball, every
shot dealing death. Fifty, a hundred of them,
crouched in heaps on the ground; priests and
Chinese women, as well as men, brought stones,
bricks, marble, no matter what, from the cathedral,
and with the mortar they had ready they
closed the breach and were saved again until the
next mine exploded!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>But they came to the end of their strength, the
meagre ration of soup grew less and less, and they
could do no more.</p>

<p>The bodies of Boxers, piled up along the vast
enclosure which they so desperately defended,
filled the air with a pestilential odor; dogs were
attracted and gathered in moments of calm for a
meal. During the latter part of the time they
killed these dogs from the tops of the walls and
pulled them in by means of a hook at the end of
a cord, and their meat was saved for the sick and
for nursing mothers.</p>

<p>On the day when our soldiers at last entered
the place, guided by the white-haired bishop standing
on the wall and waving the French flag, on
the day when they threw themselves with tears of
joy in one another's arms, there remained just
enough food to make, with the addition of many
leaves, one last meal.</p>

<p>"It seemed," said Monsignor Favier, "as
though Providence had counted the grains of
rice."</p>

<p>Then he spoke once more of Ensign Henry.
"The only time during the entire siege," he said,
"the only time we wept was when he died. He
remained on his feet giving his orders, although
mortally wounded in two places. When the fight
was over he came down from the breach and fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
exhausted in the arms of two of the priests; then
we all wept with the sailors, who had come up and
surrounded him. He was so charming, simple,
good, and gentle with even the humblest. To be
a soldier such as he was, to make yourself loved
like a little child, could there be anything more
beautiful?" Then after a silence he added, "And
he had faith; every morning he used to come with
us to prayers and to communion, saying with a
smile, 'One must be always ready.'"</p>

<p>It is quite dark before I take leave of the bishop,
on whom I had intended to pay a short call. All
around him now, of course, everything is desolate
and in ruins; there are no houses left, and the
streets cannot even be traced. I go away with my
two servants, our revolvers and one little lantern;
I go thinking of Ensign Henry, of his glory, of
his deliverance, of everything rather than the
insignificant detail of the road to be followed
among the ruins. Besides, it is not far, scarcely
a kilometre.</p>

<p>A violent wind extinguishes the candle in its
paper sheath, and envelops us in dust so thick
that we cannot see two steps in front of us; it is
like a thick fog. So, never having been in this
quarter before, we are lost, and go stumbling
along over stones, over rubbish, over broken pottery,
and human bones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>We can scarcely see the stars for the thick cloud
of dust, and we don't know which way to go.</p>

<p>Suddenly we get the smell of a dead body and
we recognize the ditch we discovered yesterday
morning just in time to keep from falling into it.
So all is well; only two hundred metres more and
we shall be at home in our glass palace.</p>


<h3>XI</h3>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Friday</span>, October 26.<br />
</div>

<p>Leaving my palace a little late, I hasten to keep
the appointment made for me by Li-Hung-Chang
for nine o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>An African chasseur accompanies me. Following
a Chinese outrider sent to guide us, we start
off at a rapid trot through the dust and silence
under the sun's white rays, along the great walls
and marshy moats of the Emperor's Palace.</p>

<p>When we get outside of the Yellow City noise
and life begin again. After the magnificent solitude
to which we have become accustomed, whenever
we return to everybody's Pekin, we are
surprised to find such a roar among these humble
crowds; it is hard to realize that the woods, the
lakes, the horizons, which play at being the real
country, are artificial things surrounded on all
sides by the most swarming of cities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>It is incontestable that the people are returning
in crowds to Pekin. (According to Monsignor
Favier, the Boxers in particular are returning in
all kinds of costumes and disguises.) From day to
day the number of silk gowns, blue cotton gowns,
slanting eyes, and queues increases.</p>

<p>We must move faster in spite of all the people,
for it seems it is still some distance, and time is
passing. Our outrider appears to be galloping.
We cannot see him, for here the streets are even
dustier than in the Yellow City; we see only the
cloud of dust that envelops his little Mongolian
horse, and we follow that.</p>

<p>At the end of half an hour's rapid riding the
dust cloud stops in front of a ramshackle old house
in a narrow street that leads nowhere. Is it
possible that Li-Hung-Chang, rich as Aladdin,
the owner of palaces and countless treasures, one
of the most enduring favorites of the Empress
and one of the glories of China, lives here?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For reasons unknown to me, the entrance is
guarded by Cossack soldiers in poor uniforms but
with naïve rosy faces. The room into which I
am taken is dilapidated and untidy; there is a table
in the middle of it and two or three rather well-carved
ebony chairs; but that is all. At one end
is a chaos of trunks, bags, packages, and bedding,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
all tied up as though in preparation for flight.
The Chinese who comes to the door, in a beautiful
gown of plum-colored silk, gives me a seat and
offers me tea. He is the interpreter, and speaks
French correctly, even elegantly. He tells me
that some one has gone to announce me to his
Highness.</p>

<p>At a sign from another Chinese he presently
conducts me into a second court, and there, at the
door leading into a reception-room, a tall old man
advances to meet me. At his right and his left
are silk-robed servants, both a whole head shorter
than he is, on whose shoulders he leans. He is
colossal, with very prominent cheek-bones, and
small, very small, quick and searching eyes. He is
an exaggeration of the Mongolian type, with a certain
beauty withal, and the air of a great personage,
although his furry gown of an indefinite color
is worn and spotted. (I have been forewarned
that in these days of abomination his Highness
believes that he should affect poverty.) The
large shabby room where he receives me is, like
the first one, strewn with trunks and packages.
We take arm-chairs opposite each other, while
servants place cigarettes, tea, and champagne on
a table between us. At first we stare at each other
like two beings from different worlds.</p>

<p>After inquiring as to my age and the amount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
of my income (one of the rules of Chinese politeness),
he bows again, and conversation begins.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When we have finished discussing the burning
questions of the day, Li-Hung-Chang expresses
sympathy for China and for ruined Pekin. "Having
visited the whole of Europe," he says, "I have
seen the museums of all your great capitals. Pekin
had her own also, for the whole Yellow City was
a museum begun centuries ago, and may be compared
with the most beautiful of your own. And
now it is destroyed."</p>

<p>He questions me as to what we are doing over
in the Palace of the North, informs himself by
adroit questioning as to whether we are injuring
anything there. He knows as well as I do what
we are doing, for he has spies everywhere, even
among our workmen; yet his enigmatical face
shows some satisfaction when I confirm his knowledge
of the fact that we are destroying nothing.</p>

<p>When the audience is over, and we have shaken
hands, Li-Hung-Chang, still leaning on his two
servants, comes with me as far as the centre of
the court. As I turn at the threshold to make my
final bow, he courteously recalls to my memory my
offer to send him my account of my stay in Pekin,&mdash;if
ever I find time to write it. In spite of the
perfect grace of his reception of me, due especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
to my title of "Mandarin of Letters," this old
prince of the Chinese Arabian Nights' tales, in
his threadbare garments and in his wretched surroundings,
has not ceased to seem to me disturbing,
inscrutable, and possibly secretly disdainful
and ironical, all the time disguising his real
self.</p>

<p>I now make my way across two kilometres of
rubbish to the quarters of the European legations
in order to take leave of the French minister, who
is still ill in bed, and to get from him his commissions
for the admiral, for I must leave Pekin
not later than the day after to-morrow, and go
back to my ship.</p>

<p>Just as I was mounting my horse again, after
this visit, to return to the Yellow City, some one
from the legation came out and very kindly gave
me some precise and very curious information
which will enable me this evening to purloin two
tiny shoes that once belonged to the Empress of
China, and to take them away as a part of the pillage.
On a shady island in the southern part of
the Lake of the Lotus is a frail, almost hidden
palace, where the sovereign slept that last agonizing
night before her frantic flight, disguised as
a beggar. <i>The second room to the left, at the back
of the second court</i> of this palace, was her room,
and there, it seems, under a carved bed, lie two
little red silk shoes embroidered with butterflies
and flowers, which must have belonged to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 900px;">
<img src="images/i199.jpg" width="900" height="710" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">An Imperial Palace</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>I return to the Yellow City as fast as I can,
breakfast hurriedly in the glass gallery,&mdash;whence
the wonderful treasures are already being carried
to their new quarters to make way for the carpenters,
who soon begin their work here,&mdash;and
straightway depart with my two faithful servants,
on foot this time, in search of the island, the palace,
and the pair of small shoes.</p>

<p>The one o'clock sun is burning the dry paths,
and the cedars overhead are gray with dust. About
two kilometres to the south of our residence we
find the island without difficulty. It is in a region
where the lake divides into various little arms,
spanned by marble bridges with marble railings
entwined with green. The palace stands there
light and charming, half concealed among the
trees, on a terrace of white marble. The roofs of
green faience touched with gilt and the openwork
walls shine forth with new and costly ornamentation
from amid the dusty green of the old cedars.
It must have been a marvel of grace and daintiness,
and it is adorable as it is, deserted and silent.</p>

<p>Through the doors opening onto the white steps
that lead up to it, a perfect cascade of débris of all
kinds is tumbling,&mdash;boxes of imperial porcelains,
boxes of gold lacquer, small bronze dragons upside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
down, bits of rose-colored silk, and bunches
of artificial flowers. Barbarians have been this
way,&mdash;but which? Surely not our soldiers, for
this part of the Yellow City was never placed in
their hands; they are not familiar with it.</p>

<p>The interior courts, from which at our approach
a flock of crows rise, are in the same condition.
The pavement is strewn with delicate, rather feminine
things, which have been ruthlessly destroyed.
And so recent is this destruction that the light
stuffs, the silk flowers, the parts of costumes have
not even lost their freshness.</p>

<p>"At the back of the second court, the second
room to the left!" Here it is! There remains a
throne, some arm-chairs, and a big, low bed, carved
by the hand of genius. Everything has been ransacked.
The window-glass, through which the
sovereign could gaze upon the reflections of
the lake and the pink blossoms of the lotus, the
marble bridges, the islands, the whole landscape
devised and realized for her eyes, has been broken;
and a fine white silk, with which the walls were
hung, and on which some exquisite artist had
painted in pale tints, larger than nature, other
lotus blossoms, languishing, bent by the autumn
wind, and strewing their petals, has been torn in
shreds.</p>

<p>Under the bed, where I look immediately, is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
pile of manuscript and charming bits of silk. My
two servants, foraging with sticks, like rag-pickers,
soon succeed in finding what I seek,&mdash;the two
comical little red shoes, one after the other.</p>

<p>They are not the absurd, doll-like shoes worn by
the Chinese women who compress their toes; the
Empress, being a Tartar princess, did not deform
her feet, which were, however, very small by
nature. No, these are embroidered slippers of
natural shape, whose extravagance lies in the heels,
which are thirty centimetres high and extend over
the entire sole, growing larger at the bottom, like
the base of a statue, to prevent the wearer from
falling; they are little blocks of white leather of
the most improbable description.</p>

<p>I had no idea that a woman's shoes could take
up so much space. How to get them away without
looking like pillagers in the eyes of the servants
and guards we meet on the way back is the
question?</p>

<p>Osman suggests suspending them by strings to
Renaud's belt so that they will hang concealed by
his long winter coat. This is an admirable scheme;
he can even walk&mdash;we make him try it&mdash;without
giving rise to suspicion. I feel no remorse, and
I fancy that if she, from afar, could witness the
scene, the still beautiful Empress would be the
first to smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>We now hasten our steps back to the Palace of
the Rotunda, where I have scarcely two hours of
daylight for my work before the cold and the night
come on.</p>

<p>Each time that I return to this palace I am
charmed with the sonorous silence of my high
esplanade and with the top of the crenellated wall
surrounding it,&mdash;an artificial spot whence one
commands an extended view of artificial landscape,
the sight of which has always been forbidden, and
which, until lately, no European has ever seen.</p>

<p>Everything about the place is so Chinese that
one feels as though it were the heart of the yellow
country, the very quintessence of China. These
high gardens were a favorite resort for the ultra-Chinese
reveries of an uncompromising Empress
who possibly dreamed of shutting her country off
from the rest of the world, as in olden times, but
who to-day sees her empire crumbling at her feet,
rotten to the core, like her myriads of temples and
gilded wooden gods.</p>

<p>The magical hour here is when the enormous
red ball, which the Chinese sun appears to be on
autumn evenings, lights up the roofs of the Violet
City before it disappears. I never fail to leave my
kiosk at this hour to see once more these effects,
unique in all the world.</p>

<p>Compared to this, what barbaric ugliness is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
offered by a bird's-eye view of one of our European
cities,&mdash;a mass of ugly gables, tiles, and
dirty roofs full of chimneys and stove-pipes, and,
as a last horror, electric wires forming a black
network! In China, where they are all too scornful
of pavements and sewers, everything which
rises into the air, into the domain of the ever-watchful
and protecting spirits, is always impeccable.
And this immense Imperial retreat, empty
to-day, now displays for me alone the splendor of
its enamelled roofs.</p>

<p>In spite of their age, these pyramids of yellow
faience, carved with a grace unknown to us, are
still brilliant under the red sun. At each of the
corners of the topmost one the ornaments simulate
great wings; lower down, toward the outside, are
rows of monsters in poses which are copied and
recopied, century after century, sacred and unchanging.
These pyramids of yellow faience are
brilliant. From far off, against the ashy blue sky,
clouded by the everlasting dust, it looks like a city
of gold; then, as the sun sinks, like a city of
copper.</p>

<p>First the silence of it all; then the croakings
that begin the moment the ravens go to rest;
then the death-like cold that wraps this magnificence
of enamel as in a winding-sheet as soon as
the sun goes down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>To-night again, when we leave the Rotunda
Palace, we pass the Palace of the North without
stopping, and go on to Monsignor Favier's.</p>

<p>He receives me in the same white room, where
valises and travelling-bags are lying about on
the furniture. The bishop leaves to-morrow for
Europe, which he has not seen for twelve years.
He is going to Rome to see the Pope, and then to
France, to raise money for his suffering missions.
His great work of over forty years is annihilated,
fifteen thousand of his Christian converts massacred;
his churches, chapels, hospitals, schools,
are all destroyed, razed to the ground; his cemeteries
have been violated, and yet, discouraged at
nothing, he wishes to begin all over again.</p>

<p>As he conducts me across his garden I admire
the beautiful energy with which he says, pointing
to the damaged cathedral with its broken cross,
which is the only building left standing, gloomily
outlined against the evening sky: "I will rebuild,
larger and higher, all the churches they have
thrown down, and I hope that each movement of
violence and hatred against us may carry Christianity
one step further on in their country. Possibly
they will again destroy my churches; who
knows? If so, I will build them up again, and we
shall see whether they or I will be the first to weary
of it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>He seems very great to me in his determination
and in his faith, and I understand that China must
reckon with this apostle of the vanguard.</p>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Saturday</span>, October 27.<br />
</div>

<p>I wanted to see the Violet City and its throne
rooms once more before going away, and to enter
it this time, not by round-about ways and back
doors and secret posterns, but by the great avenues
and gates that have been for centuries closed, so
that I might try to imagine beneath the destruction
of to-day what must have been in former
times the splendor of the sovereigns' arrival.</p>

<p>No one of our European capitals has been conceived
and laid out with such unity and audacity,
with the idea of increasing the magnificence of a
pageant always dominant, especially that of imparting
an imposing effect to the appearance of
the Emperor. The throne is here the central idea.
This city, as regular as a geometrical figure, seems
to have been created solely to enclose and glorify
the throne of the Son of Heaven, ruler of four
hundred millions of souls; to be its peristyle, to
lead up to it by colossal avenues which recall
Thebes or Babylon. It is easy to understand why
the Chinese ambassadors, who came to visit our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
kings in the times when their immense country
was flourishing, were not particularly dazzled by
the sight of the Paris of those days, of the Louvre
or of Versailles.</p>

<p>The southern gate of Pekin, by which the processions
arrive, lies in the axis of this throne, once
so awe-inspiring, and six kilometres of avenues,
with gateways and monsters, lead up to it. When
one has crossed the wall of the Chinese City by
this southern gate, first passing two huge sanctuaries,&mdash;the
Temple of Agriculture and the Temple
of Heaven,&mdash;one follows for half an hour the
great artery that leads to a second boundary wall,
that of the Tartar City, higher and more commanding
than the first. An enormous gate looms
up, surmounted by a black dungeon, and beyond
this the avenue goes on, flawlessly straight and
magnificent, to a third gate in a third wall of
a blood-red color,&mdash;the wall of the Imperial
City.</p>

<p>Even after entering the Imperial City it is still
some distance to the throne to which one is advancing
in a straight line,&mdash;to this throne which
dominates everything and which formerly could
never have been seen; but here its presence is
indicated by the surroundings. From this point
the number of marble monsters increases; lions
of colossal size grin from their pedestals at right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
and at left; there are marble obelisks&mdash;monoliths
encircled with dragons&mdash;with the same heraldic
beast always seated at the summit,&mdash;a thin kind
of jackal with long ears, which has the appearance
of barking or howling in the direction of the
extraordinary thing which is on ahead, namely,
the throne of the Emperor. Walls are multiplied,&mdash;blood-colored
walls thirty metres thick,&mdash;which
cross the road, and are surmounted by queer roofs
and pierced by low gates,&mdash;narrow ambushes that
send a thrill of terror to your heart. The defending
moats at the foot of the walls have marble
bridges, triple like the gates, and from here on the
road is paved with superb big slabs crossing one
another at an angle, like the boards of a parquetry
floor.</p>

<p>After it reaches the Imperial City, this avenue,
already a league in length, is absolutely unfrequented,
and goes on even wider than before between
long regular buildings intended for soldiers'
barracks. No more little gilded houses, no more
small shops, no more crowds! At this last imprisoning
rampart the life of the people stops,
under the oppression of the throne; and at the
very end of this solitary roadway, watched over
by the slender marble beasts surmounting the
obelisks, the forbidden centre of Pekin becomes
visible, the retreat of the Son of Heaven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>The last wall which appears ahead of us&mdash;that
of the Violet City&mdash;is, like the preceding ones,
the color of dried blood; there are numerous
watch-towers upon it, whose roofs of dark enamel
curve up at the corners in wicked little points.
The triple gates are too small, too low for the
height of the wall, too deep and tunnel-like. Oh,
the heaviness, the hugeness of it all, and the
strangeness of the design of the roofs, so characteristic
of the peculiarities of the yellow colossus!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Things must have begun to go to pieces here
centuries ago; the red plaster of the walls has
fallen in places, or it has become spotted with
black; the marble of the obelisks and the great
squinting lions could only have grown so yellow
under the rains of innumerable seasons, and the
green that pushes through wherever the granite
is joined, marks with lines of velvet the design of
the pavement.</p>

<p>The last triple gates, given over since the defeat
to a detachment of American soldiers, will
open to-day for any barbarian, such as I, who
carries a properly signed permit.</p>

<p>Passing through the tunnels, one enters an immense
marble whiteness,&mdash;a whiteness that is
turning into ivory yellow and is stained by the
autumn leaves and the wild growth that has invaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
this deserted spot. The place is paved with
marble, and straight ahead, rising like a wall, is
an extraordinary marble terrace, on which stands
the throne room, with its sturdy blood-red columns
and its roof of old enamel. This white enclosure
is like a cemetery&mdash;so much green has
pushed its way up between the paving-stones,&mdash;where
the silence is broken only by the magpies
and the crows.</p>

<p>On the ground are ranged blocks of bronze all
similar and cone-like in shape; they are simply
placed there among the brown leaves and branches,
and can be moved about as if they were ninepins.
They are used during the formal entry of a procession
to mark the line for the flags and the
places where even the most magnificent visitors
must prostrate themselves when the Son of
Heaven deigns to appear, like a god, on top of
the marble terrace, surrounded by banners, and
in one of those costumes with breastplate of gold,
monsters' heads on the shoulders, and gold wings
in the headdress, whose superhuman splendor has
been transmitted to us by means of the paintings
in the Temple of Ancestors.</p>

<p>One mounts to these terraces by staircases of
Babylonian proportions and by an "imperial
path," reserved for the Emperor alone, that is to
say, by an inclined plane made of one block of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
marble,&mdash;one of those untransportable blocks
which men in the past possessed the secret of
moving. The five-clawed dragon displays his
sculptured coils from the top to the bottom of
this stone, which cuts the big white staircase into
two equal parts, of which it forms the centre,
and extends right to the foot of the throne. No
Chinese would dare to walk on this "path" by
which the emperors descend, pressing the high
soles of their shoes on the scales of the heraldic
beast, in order not to slip.</p>

<p>The room at the top, open to-day to all the
winds that blow and to all the birds of heaven,
has, by way of roof, the most prodigious mass of
yellow faience that there is in Pekin, and the most
bristling with monsters; the ornaments at the
corners are shaped like big extended wings. Inside,
needless to say, there is that blaze of reddish
gold which always pursues one in Chinese palaces.
On the ceiling, which is of an intricate design,
dragons are everywhere entwined, entangled, interwoven;
their claws and their horns appear,
mingled with the clouds, and one of them, which
is detached from the mass and seems ready to fall,
holds in his hanging jaw a gold sphere directly
above the throne. The throne, which is of red and
gold lacquer, rises in the centre of this shadowy
place on a sort of platform; two large screens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
made of feathers, emblems of sovereignty, stand
behind it, and along the steps which lead up to
it are incense-burners similar to those placed in
pagodas at the feet of the gods.</p>

<p>Like the avenues through which I have come,
like the series of bridges and the triple gates, this
throne is in the exact centre of Pekin, and represents
its soul; were it not for all these walls, all
these various enclosures, the Emperor, seated there
on this pedestal of lacquer and marble, could see
to the farthest extremities of the city, to the farthest
openings in the surrounding walls; the tributary
sovereigns who come there, the ambassadors,
the armies, from the moment of their entrance into
Pekin by the southern gate, would be, so to speak,
under the inspiration of his invisible eyes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the floor a thick carpet of imperial yellow
reproduces in a much worn design the battle of
the chimæras, the nightmare carved upon the ceiling;
it is a carpet made in one piece, an enormous
carpet of a wool so thick and close that one's
feet sink into it as on a grassy lawn; but it is torn,
eaten by moths, with piles of gray dung lying
about on it in patches,&mdash;for magpies, pigeons,
and crows have made their nests in the roof, and
on my arrival the place is filled with the whirring
of frightened wings up high against the shining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
beams, amongst the golden dragons and the
clouds.</p>

<p>The incomprehensible fact about this palace,
to us uninitiated barbarians, is that there are
three of these rooms exactly alike, with the
same throne, the same carpet, the same ornaments,
in the same places; they are preceded by
the same great marble courts and are constructed
on the same marble terraces; you reach them
by the same staircases and by the same imperial
paths.</p>

<p>Why should there be three of them? For, of
necessity, the first conceals the two others, and in
order to pass from the first to the second, or from
the second to the third, you must go down each
time into a vast gloomy court without any view
and then come up again between the piles of ivory-colored
marble, so superb, yet so monotonous and
oppressive!</p>

<p>There must be some mysterious reason connected
with the use of the number three. This
repetition produced on our disordered imaginations
an effect analogous to that of the three similar
sanctuaries and the three similar courts in the
great Temple of the Lamas.</p>

<p>I had already seen the private apartments of the
young Emperor. Those of the Empress&mdash;for she
had apartments here too, in addition to the frail
palaces her fancy had scattered over the parks of
the Yellow City&mdash;those of the Empress are less
gloomy and much less dark. Room after room
exactly alike, with large windows and superb yellow
enamelled roofs. Each one has its marble
steps, guarded by two lions all shining with gold,
and the little gardens which separate them are
filled with bronze ornaments, heraldic beasts, ph&oelig;nixes,
or crouching monsters.</p>

<p>Inside are yellow silks and square arm-chairs
of the form consecrated by time, unchanging as
China itself. On the chests, on the tables, a quantity
of precious articles are placed in small glass
cases,&mdash;because of the perpetual dust of Pekin,&mdash;and
this makes them as cheerless as mummies and
casts over the apartment the chill of a museum.
There are many artificial bouquets of chimerical
flowers of neutral shades in amber, jade, agate,
and moonstones.</p>

<p>The great and inimitable luxury of these palace
rooms consists of the series of ebony arches so
carved as to seem a bower of dark leaves. In
what far-away forest did the trees grow that permitted
such groves to be created out of one single
piece? And by means of what implements and
what patience are they able to carve each stem and
each leaf of light bamboo, or each fine needle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the cedar, out of the very heart of the tree, and to
add to them birds and butterflies of the most exquisite
workmanship?</p>

<p>Behind the sleeping-room of the Empress a
kind of dark oratory is filled with Buddhistic
divinities on altars. An exquisite odor still remains,
left behind her by the beautiful, passionate,
elegant old woman who was queen. Among
these gods is a small creature made of very old
wood, quite worn and dull from the loss of gilding,
who wears about his neck a collar of fine
pearls. In front of him is a bunch of dried
flowers,&mdash;a last offering, one of the guardian
eunuchs informs me, made by the Empress to this
little old Buddha, who was her favorite fetish, at
the supreme moment before her flight from the
Violet City.</p>

<p>To-day I have reached this retreat by a very
different route from the one I took on my first
pilgrimage here, and in going out I must now
pass through the quarters where all is walled and
rewalled, the gates barricaded and guarded by
more and more horrible monsters. Are there hidden
princesses and treasures here? There is always
the same bloody color on the walls, the same
yellow faience on the roofs, and more horns, claws,
cruel forms, hyena smiles, projecting teeth, and
squinting eyes than ever; the most unimportant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
things, like bolts and locks, have features that
simulate hatred and death.</p>

<p>Everything is perishing from old age; the stones
are worn away, the wooden doors are falling into
dust. There are some old shadowy courts that are
given up to white-bearded octogenarian servants,
who have built cabins, where they live like recluses,
occupied in training magpies or in cultivating
sickly flowers in pots under the eyes of the
everlasting grinning old marble and bronze beasts.
No cloistered green, no monk's cell, was ever half
so gloomy as these little courts, so shut in and so
dark, overshadowed for centuries by the uncontrolled
caprices of the Chinese emperors. The inexorable
sentence, "Leave hope behind, all those
who enter here," seems to belong here; as one
proceeds, the passages grow narrower and more
intricate; it seems as though there were no escape,
as though the great locks on the doors would refuse
to work, as though the walls would close in
upon and crush you.</p>

<p>Yet here I am almost outside, outside the interior
wall and through the massive gates that
quickly close behind me. Now I am between the
second rampart and the first, both equally terrible.
I am on the road which makes a circle
around this city,&mdash;a sort of ominous passageway
of great length that runs between two dark red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
walls and which seems to meet in the distance
ahead of me. Human bones and old rags that
have been parts of the clothing of soldiers are
scattered here and there, and one sees two or three
crows and one of the flesh-eating dogs prowling
about.</p>

<p>When the boards which barricade the outside
gate are let down for me (the gate guarded by
the Japanese), I discover, as though on awakening
from a dreadful dream, that I am in the park
of the Yellow City, in open space under the great
cedars.</p>


<h3>XIII</h3>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Sunday</span>, October 28.<br />
</div>

<p>The Island of Jade, on the Lake of the Lotus, is
a rock, artificial perhaps, in spite of its mountainous
proportions. Old trees cling to its sides, and
old temples loom up toward the sky, while crowning
all is a sort of tower or dungeon of colossal
size and of a mysterious Baroque design. It may
be seen from all points; its excessively Chinese outlines
dominate Pekin, and high up on it stands a
terrible idol whose threatening attitude and hideous
smile look down upon the city. This idol our
soldiers call the "big devil of China."</p>

<p>This morning I am climbing up to visit this
"big devil."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>A bridge of white marble across the reeds and
lotus gives access to the Island of Jade. Both ends
of the bridge are guarded, needless to say, by
marble monsters who leer and squint at any one
who has the audacity to pass. The shores of
the island rise abruptly underneath the cedar
branches, and one begins immediately to climb by
means of steps and rock-cut paths. Among the
severe trees is a series of marble terraces with
bronze incense-burners and occasional pagodas,
out of whose obscurity enormous golden idols
shine forth.</p>

<p>This Island of Jade, on account of its position
of strategic importance, is under military occupation
by a company of our marines.</p>

<p>As there is no shelter other than the pagodas,
and no camp beds other than the sacred tables, our
soldiers have had to put out of doors the entire
population of secondary gods in order to make
room to lie down on the beautiful red tables at
night, and have left only the big, solemn idols on
their thrones. So here they are by the hundreds,
by the thousands, lined up on the white terraces
like playthings. Inside the temples the guns of our
men are lying about, and their blankets and their
clothing hang on the walls, all around the big idols
who have been left in their places. What a heavy
smell of leather they have already introduced into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
these closed sanctuaries, accustomed only to the
odor of sandalwood and incense!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Through the twisted branches of the cedars the
horizon, which is occasionally visible, is all green,
turning to an autumn brown. It is a wood, an
infinite wood, out of which here and there roofs
of yellow faience emerge. This wood is Pekin;
not at all as one imagines it, but Pekin seen from
the top of a very sacred place where no Europeans
were ever allowed to come.</p>

<p>The rocky soil grows thinner and thinner as one
rises toward the "big devil of China," as one
approaches the peak of the isolated cone known as
the Island of Jade.</p>

<p>This morning I meet, as I climb, a curious band
of pilgrims who are coming down; they are
Lazarist missionaries in mandarin costume, wearing
long queues. With them are several young
Chinese Catholic priests who seem frightened at
being there; as though, in spite of the Christianity
superimposed upon their hereditary beliefs, they
were committing some sacrilege by their very
presence in so forbidden a spot.</p>

<p>At the foot of the dungeon which crowns these
rocks is the kiosk of faience and marble where the
"big devil" dwells. It is high up on a narrow
terrace in the pure, clear air, from which one overlooks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
a mass of trees scarcely veiled to-day by the
usual mist of dust and sun.</p>

<p>I enter the kiosk where the "big devil" stands,
the sole guest of this aerial region. Oh, horrible
creature that he is! He is of superhuman size,
cast in bronze. Like Shiva, god of death, he
dances on dead bodies; he has five or six atrocious
faces whose multiplied grins are almost intolerable;
he wears a collar of skulls, and is gesticulating
with forty arms that hold instruments of torture
or heads severed from their bodies.</p>

<p>Such is the protecting divinity chosen by the
Chinese to watch over this city, and placed high
above all their pyramidal faience roofs, high above
all their pagodas and towers, as we in times of
faith would have placed the Christ or the Blessed
Virgin. It is a tangible symbol of their profound
cruelty, the index of the inexplicable cleft in the
brain of these people ordinarily so tractable and
gentle, so open to the charm of little children and
of flowers, but who are capable all at once of gleefully
becoming executioners and torturers of the
most horrible description.</p>

<p>At my feet Pekin seems like a wood! I had been
told of this incomprehensible effect, but my expectations
are surpassed. Outside of the parks
in the Imperial City, it has not seemed to me that
there were many trees around the houses, that is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
in the gardens and in the streets. But from here
all is submerged in green. Even beyond the walls
whose black outlines may be seen in the distance
there are more woods,&mdash;endless woods. Toward
the east alone lies the gray desert which I came
through that snowy morning, and toward the
north rise the Mongolian mountains, charming,
translucent, and purple against the pale blue sky.</p>

<p>The great straight arteries of the city, drawn
according to a singular plan, with a regularity and
an amplitude to be found in none of the European
capitals, resemble, from the point where I
stand, the avenues in a forest,&mdash;avenues bordered
by various complicated, delicate little fretwork
houses of gray pasteboard or of gilt paper.
Many of these arteries are dead; in those which
are still living, this fact is indicated from my point
of view by the constant moving of little brown
animals along the earth, recalling the migration
of ants; these caravans, which move slowly and
quietly away, are scattered to the four corners of
China.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A feeling that is akin to regret is mingled with
my afternoon's work in the solitude of my lofty
palace,&mdash;regret for what is about to end, for I
am now on the eve of departure. And it will be an
end without any possible beginning again, for if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
I should return to Pekin this palace would be
closed to me, or, in any case, I should never again
find here such charming solitude.</p>

<p>Yet this distant, inaccessible spot, of which it
once would have seemed madness to say that I
should ever make it my dwelling-place, has already
become very familiar to me, as well as all that
belongs here and all that has happened here,&mdash;the
presence of the great alabaster goddess in the dark
temple, the daily visit of the cat, the silence of the
surroundings, the mournful light of the October
sun, the agonies of the last butterflies as they beat
against my window-panes, the man&oelig;uvres of the
sparrows whose nests are in the enamelled roofs,
the blowing of the dead leaves, and the fall of the
little balsam needles on the pavement of the esplanade
whenever the wind blows. What a strange
destiny, when you think of it, has made me master
here for a few days!</p>

<p>The splendors of our long gallery in the Palace
of the North are a thing of the past. It is already
divided by light wooden partitions which may be
removed without difficulty if ever the Empress
thinks of returning, but which, for the time being,
cut it up into rooms and offices. There are still
a few magnificent bibelots in the part which is to
be the general's salon, but elsewhere it has all been
simplified; the silks, the pottery, the screens, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
bronzes, duly catalogued, have been removed to
a storehouse. Our soldiers have even found European
seats among the palace reserves, which
they have taken to the future apartments of the
staff to make them more habitable. They consist
of sofas and arm-chairs, vaguely Henry II. in
style, covered with old-gold plush that reminds
one of a provincial hotel.</p>

<p>I expect to leave to-morrow morning. When
the dinner hour unites us once again, Captain C.
and I, seated at our little ebony table, both feel
a touch of melancholy at seeing how things have
changed about us, and how quickly our dream of
being Chinese sovereigns is over.</p>

</div>

<p>I have postponed my departure for twenty-four
hours in order to meet General Vayron, who returns
to Pekin this evening, and undertake his
commissions for the admiral. So I have an unexpected
half-day to spend in my high mirador, and
hope for a last visit from my cat, who will find
me no more in my accustomed place, neither to-morrow
nor ever again. It is now growing colder
each day, so that in any case my work-room would
not be possible much longer.</p>

<p>Before the doors of this palace close behind me
forever I want to take a last walk into all the windings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
of the terraces, into all the kiosks, so dainty
and so charming, in which the Empress no doubt
concealed her reveries and her amours.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As I go to take leave of the great white goddess,&mdash;the
sun already setting, and the roofs of the
Violet City bathed in the red golds of evening,&mdash;I
find the aspect of things about here changed; the
soldiers who were on guard at the gate have
climbed to the top and are putting her house in
order; they have carried off the thousand and one
boxes of porcelains and girandoles, the broken
vases and the bouquets, and have carefully swept
the place. The alabaster goddess, deliciously pale
in her golden robes, still smiles, more than ever
solitary in her empty temple.</p>

<p>The sun of this last day sets in little wintry
clouds that are cold to look at, and the Mongolian
wind makes me shiver in my thick cloak as I cross
the Marble Bridge on my return to the Palace of
the North, where the general with his escort of
cavalry has just arrived.</p>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Tuesday</span>, October 30.<br />
</div>

<p>On horseback, at seven in the morning, a changelessly
beautiful sun and an icy wind. I start off
with my two servants, young Toum, and a small
escort of two African chasseurs, who will accompany<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
me as far as my junk. We have about six
kilometres to cover before reaching the dreary
country. We first cross the Marble Bridge, then,
leaving the great Imperial wood, pass through
ruined, squalid Pekin in a cloud of dust.</p>

<p>At length, after going through the deep gates
in the high outer ramparts, we reach the outside
desert, swept by a terrible wind; and here the
enormous Mongolian camels, with lions' manes,
perpetually file past in a procession, making our
horses start with fear.</p>

<p>We reach Tong-Tchow in the afternoon, and
silently cross it, ruined and dead, until we come
to the banks of the Pei-Ho. There I find my junk
under the care of a soldier,&mdash;the same junk that
brought me from Tien-Tsin with all the necessities
for our life on the water intact. Nothing has been
taken during my absence but my stock of pure
water,&mdash;a serious loss for us, but a pardonable
theft at a time like this, when the river water is
full of danger for our soldiers. As for us, we
can drink hot tea.</p>

<p>We call at the office of the commissary to get
our rations and to have our papers signed; then
we pull up our anchor from the infected bank that
breathes of pestilence and death, and begin to float
down the river toward the sea.</p>

<p>Although it is colder than it was coming up, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
is almost amusing to take up a nomadic life again
in our little sarcophagus with its matting roof, and
to plunge once more, as night falls, into the immense
green solitude of the dark banks as we
glide along between them.</p>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Wednesday</span>, October 31.<br />
</div>

<p>The morning sun shines on the bridge of a junk
that is covered with a thin coating of ice. The
thermometer marks 8° above zero, and the wind
blows, cruel and violent, but health-giving, we
feel sure.</p>

<p>We have the swift current with us, so that the
desolate shores, with their ruins and their dead, slip
by much more rapidly than on our other journey.
We walk on the tow-path from morning until
night in order to keep warm, almost abreast of the
Chinese who are pulling the rope. There is a fulness
of physical life in the wind; one feels light
and full of energy.</p>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Thursday</span>, November 1.<br />
</div>

<p>Our boat trip lasts only forty-eight hours this
time, and we have but two frosty nights to sleep
under a matting roof through which the shining
stars are visible, for toward the end of the second
day we enter Tien-Tsin.</p>

<p>Tien-Tsin, where we have to find a shelter for
the night, is horribly repopulated since our last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
stay here. It takes us almost two hours to row
across the immense city, working our way amongst
myriads of canoes and junks. Both banks are
crowded with Chinese, howling, gesticulating,
buying, and selling, in spite of the fact that few
of the walls or roofs of the houses are left intact.</p>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Friday</span>, November 2.<br />
</div>

<p>In spite of the cold wind and the dust, which
continues to blow pitilessly, we arrive at Taku,&mdash;horrible
city,&mdash;at the mouth of the river, by mid-day.
But alas! it will be impossible to join the
squadron to-day; the tides are unfavorable, the
bar in bad condition, the sea too high. Perhaps
to-morrow or the next day.</p>

<p>I had almost had time to forget the difficulties
and uncertainties of life in this place,&mdash;the perpetual
anxiety in regard to the weather, the concern
for this or that boat laden with soldiers or
supplies, which is running some danger outside or
which may founder on the bar; complications and
dangers of all sorts connected with the disembarking
of troops,&mdash;a thing which seems so simple
when looked at from a distance, but which is surrounded
by a world of difficulties in such places.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Saturday</span>, November 3.<br />
</div>

<p><i>En route</i> this morning for the squadron out on
the open sea. At the end of a half hour the sinister
shore of China disappears behind us, and the
smoke-stacks of the iron-clads begin to pour forth
their black smoke upon the horizon. We fear we
shall have to turn back, the weather is so bad.</p>

<p>Dripping with fog, however, we arrive at last,
and I jump aboard the <i>Redoutable</i>, where my
comrades, with no taste of high life in China to
break the monotony, have been at work for forty
days.<br /></p>

<h2>V<br />
RETURN TO NING-HIA</h2>


<p>Six weeks later. A cold and gloomy morning.
After having been at Tien-Tsin, Pekin,
and other places, where so many strange and
gloomy things have come to our notice, here we
are back again at Ning-Hia, which we have had
time to forget; our boat has gone back to its old
moorings, and we return to the French fort.</p>

<p>It is cold and dull; autumn, which is so severe
in these parts, has brought with it sudden frosts;
the birches and willows have lost all their leaves,
and the sky is cold and lowering.</p>

<p>The Zouaves who are living in the fort, and
who came so light-heartedly only a month ago to
take the place of our sailors, have already buried
some of their number, who died of typhus or were
shot. This very morning we have paid the last
honors to two of them, killed by Russian balls in
a particularly tragic manner, all the result of a
mistake.</p>

<p>The sandy roads strewn with yellow leaves are
solitary. The Cossacks have evacuated their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
camps and disappeared to the other side of the
Great Wall, in the direction of Manchuria. The
agitation of the earlier days is over, as well as
the confusion and the joyous crowds; all have
gone into winter quarters in the places assigned
to them, and as the peasants of the vicinity have
not returned, their villages are abandoned and
empty.</p>

<p>The fort, though still ornamented with Chinese
emblems, now bears a French name; it is called
"Fort Admiral-Pottier." As we entered trumpets
resounded for the admiral, and the Zouaves, ranged
under the guns, looked with respectful sorrow at
their chief, who had just honored with his presence
the funeral services of two soldiers.</p>

<p>As soon as we cross the threshold we feel quite
unexpectedly as though we were on French soil;
it would be hard to say by what spell these Zouaves
have made of this place and its surroundings in
one short month, something which is like a bit of
home.</p>

<p>There have been no great changes; they have
been content with removing Chinese filth, with
putting the war supplies in order, with whitewashing
their quarters, and with organizing a
bakery where the bread has a good smell, and a
hospital where the many wounded, alas, and the
sick, sleep on very clean little camp beds. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
this at once and quite inexplicably creates a feeling
that one is in France again.</p>

<p>In the court of honor in the centre of the fort,
in front of the door leading to the room where the
mandarin is enthroned, two gun-carriages stand,
unharnessed. Their wheels are decorated with
leaves and they are covered over with white sheets,
upon which are scattered poor little bouquets fastened
on with pins. They are the last flowers
from the neighboring Chinese gardens,&mdash;poor
chrysanthemums and stunted roses touched by
the frost, all arranged with touching care and
kindly soldierly awkwardness, for the dead comrades
who lie there on these carriages in coffins
covered with the French flag.</p>

<p>It is a surprise to find this vast mandarin's
room transformed by the Zouaves into a chapel.
A strange chapel truly! On the whitewashed
walls the vests of Chinese soldiers are fastened
up and arranged like trophies with sabres and
poniards, while the candlesticks that stand on
the white altar-cloth are made of shell and bayonets,&mdash;thus
naïvely and charmingly does the
soldier know how to manage when he is in
exile.</p>

<p>A military mass begins with trumpet blasts that
make the Zouaves fall upon their knees; mass is
said by the chaplain of the squadron, in mourning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
dress,&mdash;a mass for the dead, for the two who are
asleep on the wagons near the door decorated with
late flowers. From the court Bach's Prelude,
played on muffled brass, rises like a prayer, the
dominant note in this mingling of home and foreign
land, of funeral service and gray morning.</p>

<p>Then they depart for a near-by enclosure which
we have turned into a cemetery. Mules are harnessed
to the heavy gun-carriages, the admiral
himself leading the procession along the sandy
paths where the Zouaves form a double row, presenting
arms.</p>

<p>The sun does not pierce the autumn clouds that
lower this morning over the burial of these children
of France. It is cold and gloomy, and the
birches and willows of the desolate country continue
to drop their leaves upon us.</p>

<p>This improvised cemetery, surrounded by so
much that is exotic, has also taken on a French
air,&mdash;no doubt because of the brave home names
inscribed on wooden crosses that mark the new-made
graves; because of pots of chrysanthemums
brought by comrades to these sad mounds of earth.
And yet just beyond the wall which protects our
dead, that other wall which rises and is indefinitely
prolonged into the gray November country,
is the Great Wall of China; and we are in
exile far, frightfully far from home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>Now the coffins have been lowered, each one to
its hole, adding to the already long row of new-made
graves; all the Zouaves approach in serried
rank while their commandant recalls in a few
words how these two fell.</p>

<p>"It was not far from here. The company was
marching without suspicion in the direction of a
fort from which the Russian flag had just been
hoisted, when suddenly balls began to rain like
hail. The Russians behind their ramparts were
new-comers who had not seen the Zouaves, and
who mistook their red hats for the caps of the
Boxers. Before they recognized their mistake
several of our men lay on the ground; seven,
one of them a captain, were wounded, and these
two were dead. One of them was the sergeant
who waved our flag in an effort to stop the
firing."</p>

<p>Then the admiral addresses the Zouaves, whose
eyes, all in a row, are filled with tears; and as he
steps forward upon the pile of loose earth so that
he may reach the graves with his sword, and says
to those who lie there, "I salute you as soldiers
for the last time," a real sob is audible, heartfelt,
and unrestrained, from the breast of a big hearty
fellow who looks to be not the least brave among
those in the ranks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Beside all this, how pitifully, how ironically
empty are many of the pompous ceremonies at
official burials with their fine discourses!</p>

<p>In these times of weakness and mediocrity,
when nothing is sacred and the future is full of
fear, happy are they who are cut down where
they stand; happy are they who, young and pure,
fall for the sake of adorable dreams of country
and of honor, who are borne away wrapped in the
modest flag of their country and greeted as soldiers
with simple words that bring tears to the
eyes.</p>

<h2>VI<br />
PEKIN IN SPRINGTIME</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Thursday</span>, April 18, 1901.<br />
</div>

<p>The terrible Chinese winter which has
pursued us for four months in this ice-filled
gulf of Pekin is over, and here we
are again at our wretched post, having returned
with the spring to the thick and yellow waters at
the mouth of the Pei-Ho.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 900px;">
<img src="images/i239.jpg" width="900" height="519" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">The Mouth of the Pei-Ho</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>To-day wireless telegraphy, by a series of imperceptible
vibrations gathered at the top of the
<i>Redoutable's</i> mast, informs us that the palace of
the Empress, occupied by Field-Marshal von Waldersee,
was burned last night, and that the German
chief-of-staff perished in the flames.</p>

<p>We were the only ones of all the allied squadrons
who received this notice, and the admiral at
once ordered me to depart for Pekin to offer his
condolences, and to represent him at the funeral
ceremonies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>There was just twenty-five minutes for my
preparations, for the packing of luggage, great
and small; for the boat which must take me
ashore cannot wait without risk of missing the
tide, and so being unable to cross the bar of the
river to-night. At the end of an hour my foot
is on the soil of horrible Taku, near the French
quarter, where I must spend the night.</p>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Friday</span>, April 19.<br />
</div>

<p>The railway destroyed by the Boxers has been
rebuilt, and the train which I take this morning
goes straight to Pekin, arriving there about four
o'clock this afternoon,&mdash;a rapid and commonplace
journey, very different from the one I
made at the beginning of winter by junk and
on horseback.</p>

<p>The spring rains have not begun; the chill verdure
of May, the sorghos and the young willows,
later than they are in our climate, emerge with
great difficulty from the dry soil and cast a hesitating
shadow upon the Chinese plains, powdered
with gray dust and burned by an already torrid
sun.</p>

<p>And how different is the appearance of Pekin!
The first time we approached it, not by the superhuman
ramparts of the Tartar City, but by those
of the Chinese City, less imposing and less sombre.</p>

<p>To my surprise the train passes right through a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
fresh breach in the wall, enters the heart of the
town, and lands one at the door of the Temple of
Heaven. It seems that it is the same with the
line from Pao-Ting-Fou; the Babylonian enclosure
has been pierced, and the railroad enters Pekin
and comes to an end only at the imperial quarters.
What unheard-of changes the Celestial Emperor
will find if he ever returns!&mdash;locomotives whistling
and running right through this old capital of
stability and decay.</p>

<p>On the platform of the temporary station there
was an almost joyous animation, and many Europeans,
too, were on hand to meet the incoming
travellers.</p>

<p>Among the numerous officers who were there
is one whom I recognize, although I never have
seen him, and toward whom I advance spontaneously,&mdash;Colonel
Marchand, the well-known hero,
who arrived in Pekin last November, after I had
left. We take a carriage together bound for the
French quarter, where I am to be entertained.</p>

<p>The general quarters are a league away, still
in the small Palace of the North, which was
known to me in its Chinese splendor, and of
whose earlier transformations I was a witness.
The colonel himself lives near by in the Rotunda
Palace, and we discover in the course of conversation
that he has chosen for his private dwelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
the same kiosk which I used for my work-room
last season.</p>

<p>We make the trip by way of the grand avenue
used by processions and emperors, through the
triple gates in the colossal red walls under the
murderous dungeon; over the marble bridges between
great grinning marble lions, and between
ivory-colored obelisks surmounted by animals out
of dreamland.</p>

<p>And when, after the jolting, the noise, and the
crowds, our carriage glides at last over the large
paving-stones of the Yellow City, all this magnificence
seems to me, on second sight, more
than ever condemned,&mdash;a thing which has had
its day. Imperial Pekin, in its everlasting dust,
is now warmed by the rays of the April sun,
yet it does not waken, does not return to life
after its long, cold winter. Not a drop of rain
has fallen yet, the ground is dust, the parks are
dust.</p>

<p>The old cedars, black and powdery, seem like
the mummies of trees, whilst the green of the
monotonous willows is just beginning to appear in
the terrible ashen-white sunshine.</p>

<p>The highest roofs rise toward a clear sky which
is a mixture of heat and light,&mdash;pyramids of
gold-colored faience whose age and dilapidation
are more evident than ever amid the green and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
the birds'-nests. The Chinese storks have come
back with the spring, and are perched in rows
along the highest parts of the great roofs, on the
precious tiles, among the horns and claws and
enamelled monsters; they are small, motionless
white creatures,&mdash;half lost in the dazzling whiteness
of the sky,&mdash;who seem to be meditating on
the destruction of the city as they contemplate the
dismal dwellings at their feet. Really I find that
Pekin has aged since autumn, aged a century or
two; the April sunshine emphasizes all this and
classes it definitely among the hopeless ruins. One
feels that its end has come, and that there is no
possible resurrection for it.</p>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Saturday</span>, April 20.<br />
</div>

<p>The funeral of General Schwarzhof, one of the
greatest enemies of France, took place at nine
o'clock this morning under a torrid sun; he came
to a most unexpected end here in this Chinese
palace just as he seemed about to become quartermaster-general
of the German army.</p>

<p>The entire palace was not burned, only that
superb part where he and the marshal lived,&mdash;the
apartments with the incomparable ebony woodwork
and the throne room filled with <i>chefs-d'&oelig;uvre</i>
of ancient art.</p>

<p>The casket has been placed in one of the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
rooms left untouched by the fire. In front of the
doorway the white-haired marshal stands in the
dangerous sunshine. Somewhat overcome, but
preserving the exquisite grace of a gentleman and
a soldier, he receives the officers who are presented
to him,&mdash;officers from all countries in every kind
of dress, who arrive on horseback, on foot, and in
carriages, in cocked hats and in helmets decorated
with wings or with feathers. Timid Chinese dignitaries
who seem to belong to another world
and another age of human history come also; and
gentlemen high in the diplomatic service are not
lacking, brought here, by some anachronism, in
old Asiatic palanquins.</p>

<p>The Chinese character of the room is entirely
concealed by branches of cypress and cedar, gathered
from the imperial park by the German soldiers
and by our own; they cover the walls and
ceiling and are strewn over the floor, exhaling a
balsamic odor of the forest around the casket,
which is half hidden by white lilacs from the
Empress's garden.</p>

<p>After the address by a Lutheran pastor, there
is a chorus from Händel, sung from behind the
branches by some young German soldiers with
voices so pure and fresh that they are as restful as
music from heaven. Tame pigeons, whose habits
have been interfered with by the invasion of barbarians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
fly tranquilly above our plumed and gilded
heads.</p>

<p>At the sound of the military brasses the procession
begins to move, to make the tour of the
Lake of the Lotus. All along the road a hedge,
such as was never seen before, is formed by the
soldiers of all nations; Bavarians are followed by
Cossacks, Italians by Japanese, etc. Among so
many rather sombre uniforms the red waistcoats
of the small English detachment stand out sharply,
and their reflections in the lake are like cruel and
bloody trails. It is a very small detachment, almost
ridiculously so beside those that other countries
have sent; England is represented in China
chiefly by Indian hordes,&mdash;every one knows, alas,
with what a task her troops are elsewhere occupied
at the present moment.</p>

<p>The images of the lines of soldiers are reflected
inversely in the water as well as the great desolate
palaces, the marble quays, and the faience kiosks,
built here and there among the trees; in certain
places the lotus, which is beginning to come up
from the slimy mud, shows above the surface its
first leaves, of a green tinged with pink.</p>

<p>A stop is made at a dark pagoda, where the
coffin is temporarily left. This pagoda is so surrounded
with foliage that it seems at first as though
one were simply entering a garden of cedars, willows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
and white lilacs; but soon the eye distinguishes
behind and above this verdure other
rarer and more magnificent foliage, carved by the
Chinese for their gods in the form of clusters of
maple or of bamboo, which form under the ceiling
a high arbor of gold.</p>

<p>And here this curious funeral comes to an end.
The groups divide, sorting themselves according
to nations, and soon disperse among the hot
wooded walks in the direction of their various
palaces.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The setting of the Yellow City seems vaster,
more extensive than ever in the April light. One
is bewildered by so much artificiality. How marvellous
the genius of these people has been! To
have created bodily, in the midst of an arid plain,
a lifeless desert, a city twenty leagues in circumference,
with aqueducts, woods, rivers, mountains,
and lakes! To have created forest distances
and watery horizons, to give their sovereigns illusions
of freshness! And to have enclosed all this,&mdash;which
in itself is so large that one cannot see
its boundaries,&mdash;to have separated it from the rest
of the world, to have sequestered it, if one may
use the word, behind such formidable walls!</p>

<p>What their most audacious architects have not
been able to create, nor their proudest emperors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
is a real springtime in this parched land,&mdash;a spring
like ours, with its warm rains and its tremendously
rapid growth of grass, ferns, and flowers. Here
there is no turf, no moss, no odorous hay; the
springtime resurrection is indicated here by the
thin foliage on the willows, by tufts of grass here
and there, or by the blossoming of a sort of purple
gillyflower that springs up out of the dusty soil.
It rains only in June, and then there is a deluge
flooding all things.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Poor Yellow City, where we walk this morning,
meeting so many people, so many armed detachments,
so many uniforms; poor Yellow City, closed
to the world for so many centuries, an inviolable
refuge for the rites and mysteries of the past; city
of splendor, oppression, and silence! When I saw
it in the autumn it had an air of desertion which
suited it; but now I find it overrun by the soldiers
of all Europe. In all the palaces and golden
pagodas "barbarian" troopers drag their swords
or groom their horses under the very noses of the
great dreamy Buddhas.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I saw to-day, at a Chinese merchant's, a collection
of the ingenious terra-cotta statuettes, which
are a specialty of Tien-Tsin. Up to the present
year, only inhabitants of the Celestial Empire have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
been represented,&mdash;people of all social conditions
and in every circumstance of life; but these, inspired
by the invasion, represent various Occidental
warriors, whose types and costumes are
reproduced with astonishing accuracy. The modellers
have given to the soldiers of certain European
countries, which I prefer not to designate,
an expression of fierce rage, and have placed in
their hands light swords or bludgeons, or whips
raised as if to strike a blow.</p>

<p>Our own men wear the red cap of the country,
and are exceedingly French as to faces, with moustaches
made of yellow or brown silk; each one
carries tenderly in his arms a little Chinese baby.
They are posed in different ways, but all are inspired
by the same idea; the little Chinese is sometimes
holding the soldier by the neck and embracing
him; sometimes the soldier is tossing the laughing
child, or, again, he is carefully wrapping it in his
winter cloak. Thus it is, in the eyes of these careful
observers, that while others are rough and
always ready to strike a blow, our soldier is the
one who after the battle becomes the big brother
of the enemy's little children; after several months
of practically living together, the Chinese have
chosen this, and this alone, to characterize the
French.</p>

<p>Examples of these various statuettes ought to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
scattered broadcast throughout Europe: the comparison
would be for us a glorious trophy to bring
back from the war, and would close the mouths
of numerous imbeciles in our own country.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the afternoon Marshal von Waldersee came
to our headquarters. He was kind enough to say,
what was in fact the truth, that the fire was extinguished
almost entirely by our soldiers, led by
my friend Colonel Marchand.</p>

<p>About eleven o'clock, on the evening of the fire,
the colonel was dreaming on the high terrace of
the Rotunda Palace, in a favorable spot from
which to see the great red jet shoot superbly up
from the mass of sculptured ebony and fine lacquer,
as well as its reflection in the water. He was the
first to reach the spot with a few of our men, and
he was able to keep ten fire-engines going until
morning, while our marines, under his orders,
chopped down some of the blazing parts. It was
owing to him, also, that they were able to recover
General Schwarzhof's body. He constantly directed
a stream of water toward the spot where
he knew he had fallen, in default of which incineration
would have been complete.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>
<p>This evening I go to call on Monsignor Favier,
who has just returned from his trip to Europe,
full of confidence in his plans.</p>

<p>How changed is all connected with the Catholic
concession since the autumn! Instead of silence
and destruction all is life and activity. Eight hundred
workmen&mdash;almost all Boxers, the bishop
says with a defiant smile&mdash;are at work repairing
the cathedral, which is encased from top to bottom
in bamboo scaffoldings. The avenues about it have
been widened and planted with rows of young
acacias, and countless improvements have been
undertaken, as though an era of peace had begun
and persecutions were over forever.</p>

<p>While I am conversing with the bishop in the
white parlor, the marshal arrives. He naturally
refers again to the burning of his palace, and with
delicate courtesy informs us that of all the souvenirs
which he lost in the disaster the one he most
regrets is the Cross of the Legion of Honor.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Sunday</span>, April 21.<br />
</div>

<p>My easy mission over, there is nothing for me
to do but to return to the <i>Redoutable</i>.</p>

<p>But the general is kind enough to invite me to
remain with him for a few days. He proposes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
that we pay a visit to the tombs of the emperors
of the present dynasty, which are in a sacred wood
about fifty miles southwest of Pekin,&mdash;tombs
which never had been seen before this war, and
which probably never will be seen after it is over.
In order to accomplish this it is necessary to write
in advance to warn the mandarins, and especially
the commandants of the French posts stationed
along the route, and there is quite an expedition
to organize. So I asked the admiral for ten days,
which he kindly granted me by telegraph, and am
still here, a guest of the palace for much longer
than I expected.</p>

<p>This Sunday morning I go over to Monsignor's
cathedral to take part in the grand mass for the
Chinese.</p>

<p>I enter at the left of the nave, which is the side
for men, while the right side is reserved for women.</p>

<p>When I arrive the church is already packed with
Chinese, both men and women, kneeling close together,
and humming in an undertone a sort of
uninterrupted chant that resembles the buzzing of
an immense hive. There is a strong smell of musk,
for both cotton and silk robes are saturated with it;
and besides that there is the intolerable odor that
belongs to the yellow race, and which is something
indescribable. In front of me, to the farthest ends
of the church, men with bowed heads are kneeling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
I see backs by the hundreds with long queues hanging
over them. On the women's side are bright
silks,&mdash;a perfect medley of colors; chignons,
smooth and black as varnished ebony, with flowers
and gold pins. Everybody sings with mouths
almost closed, as if in a dream. Their devotion is
obvious, and it is touching, in spite of the extreme
drollery of the people; they really pray, and seem
to do so with fervor and humility.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now comes the spectacle for which I confess
I came,&mdash;the coming out from mass,&mdash;a great
opportunity to see some of the beautiful ladies of
Pekin, for they do not show themselves in the
street, where only women of the lower classes walk
about.</p>

<p>There were several hundred elegant women who
slowly came out, one after another, their feet too
small and their shoes too high. Oh, the line of
strange little painted faces and the finery that
emerged from that narrow doorway! The cut of
the pantaloons, the cut of the tunics, the combination
of forms and colors, must be as old as China,
and how far it seems from us! They are like dolls
of another age, another world, who have escaped
from old parasols or decorated jars, to take on reality
and life this beautiful April morning. Among
them are Chinese ladies with deformed toes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
incredibly small, pointed shoes; their stiff, heavy
masses of hair are pointed too, and arranged at
the nape of the neck like birds' tails. There are
Tartar ladies, belonging to the special aristocracy
known as "the eight banners;" their feet are natural,
but their embroidered slippers have stilt-like
heels; their hair is long, and is wound like a skein
of black silk on a piece of board placed crosswise
back of their heads, so that it forms two horizontal
cones with an artificial flower at each end.</p>

<p>They paint themselves like the wax figures at
the hairdressers',&mdash;white, with a bright pink spot
in the middle of each cheek; one feels that it is
done according to custom and etiquette, without
the least attempt at creating an illusion.</p>

<p>They chatter and laugh discreetly; they lead by
the hand the most adorable babies (who were as
good as little porcelain kittens during mass),
decked out, and their hair dressed in the most comical
fashion. Many of the women are pretty, very
pretty; almost all seem decent, reserved, and
<i>comme il faut</i>.</p>

<p>The exit from the church was accomplished
quietly, with every appearance of peace and happiness,
in complete confidence in these surroundings
so recently the scene of massacre and other horrors.
The gates of the enclosure are wide open, and a
new avenue, bordered by young trees, has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
laid out over what was not long since a charnel-house.</p>

<p>A great number of little Chinese carts, upholstered
in beautiful silk or in blue cotton, are
waiting, their heavy wheels decorated with copper;
all the dolls get in with much ceremony, and
depart as though they were leaving some festive
performance.</p>

<p>Once more the Christians in China have won
a victory, and they triumph generously&mdash;until the
next massacre.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At two o'clock to-day, as is the Sunday custom,
the marine band plays in the court at headquarters,&mdash;in
the court of the Palace of the North, which
I had known filled with strange and magnificent
débris in a cold autumn wind, but which at present
is all cleared up as neat as a pin, with the April
green beginning to show on the branches of the
little trees.</p>

<p>This semblance of a French Sunday is rather
sad. The feeling of exile which one never loses
here is made all the keener by the poor music, to
which there are but few listeners; no dressy women
or happy babies, just two or three groups of idle
soldiers and a few of the sick or wounded from
the hospital, their young faces pale and wan, one
dragging a limb, another leaning on a crutch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>And yet there are moments when it does suggest
home; the going and coming of the marines
and of the good Sisters reminds one of some little
corner of France; beyond the glass galleries which
surround this court rises the slender Gothic tower
of the neighboring church, with a large tricolored
flag floating from the top, high up in the blue sky,
dominating everything, and protecting the little
country we have improvised here in the haunts of
the Chinese emperors.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What a change has taken place in this Palace of
the North since my stay here last autumn.</p>

<p>With the exception of the part reserved for the
general and his officers, all the galleries and all the
dependencies have become hospital wards for our
soldiers. They are admirably adapted to this purpose,
for they are separated from one another by
courts, and stand on high foundations of granite.
There are two hundred beds for the poor sick soldiers,
who are most comfortably installed in them,
with light and air at pleasure, thanks to the way
this fantastic palace is built. The good Sisters
with their white pointed caps move about with
short, quick steps, distributing medicines, clean
linen, and smiles.</p>

<p>A small parlor is set apart for the head-nurse,&mdash;an
elderly woman, with a fine, wrinkled face,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
who has just received the cross, in the presence
of all the troops, for her admirable services during
the siege. Her little whitewashed parlor is altogether
typical and charming, with its six Chinese
chairs, its Chinese table, its two Chinese water-colors
of flowers and fruits that hang on the wall,&mdash;all
chosen from amongst the most modest of the
Sardanapalian reserves of the Empress; added to
these is a large plaster image of the Virgin, enthroned
in the place of honor, between two jars
filled with white lilacs.</p>

<p>White lilacs! The most magnificent bunches of
them grow in all the walled gardens of this palace;
they are the sole joyful signs of April, of real
spring under this burning sun; and they are a
boon to the Sisters, who make regular thickets of
them in honor of the Virgin and saints, on their
simple altars.</p>

<p>I had known all these mandarins' and gardeners'
houses, which extend on among the trees, in complete
disarray, filled with strange spoils, filth, and
pestilential smells; now they are clean and whitewashed,
with nothing disagreeable about them.
The nuns have established here a wash-house, there
a kitchen where good broth is made for the invalids,
or a linen room, where piles of clean-smelling
sheets and shirts for the sick are ranged
on shelves covered with immaculate papers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>Like the simplest of our sailors or soldiers, I
am very much inclined to be charmed and comforted
by the mere sight of a good Sister's cap. It
is no doubt an indication of a regrettable lack in
my imagination, but I have much less of a thrill
when I look upon the head-dress of a lay nurse.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Outside of our quarters, in these unheard-of
times for Pekin, Sunday is marked by the great
numbers of soldiers of all countries who are circulating
about its streets.</p>

<p>The city has been divided into districts, each
placed under the care of one of the invading
peoples, and the different zones mingle very little
with one another; the officers occasionally, the soldiers
almost never. As an exception, the Germans
come to us sometimes, and we go to them, for one
of the undeniable results of this war has been to
establish a sympathy between the men of the two
armies; but the international relations of our
troops are limited to this one exception.</p>

<p>The part of Pekin that fell to France&mdash;several
kilometres in circumference&mdash;is the one where
the Boxers destroyed most during the siege, the
one that is most ruined and solitary, but also the
one to which life and confidence soonest returned.
Our soldiers take kindly to the Chinese, both men
and women, and even to the babies. They have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
made friends everywhere, as may be seen by the
way the Chinese approach them instead of running
away.</p>

<p>In the French part of Pekin every little house
flies the tricolor as a safeguard. Many of the
people have even pasted on their doors placards
of white paper, obtained through the kind offices
of some of our men, on which may be read
in big, childish handwriting: "We are Chinese
protected by French" or "Here we are all Chinese
Christians."</p>

<p>And every little baby, naked or clothed, with his
ribbon and his queue, has learned, smilingly, to
make the military salute as we pass.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At sunset the soldiers turn in, the barracks are
closed. Silence and darkness everywhere.</p>

<p>The night is particularly dark. About two
o'clock I leave my quarters with one of my comrades
of the land force. Lantern in hand, we set
forth in the dark labyrinth; challenged at first
here and there by sentinels, then, meeting no one
but frightened dogs, we cross ruins, cesspools, and
wretched streets that breathe death.</p>

<p>A very dubious-looking house is our goal. The
watchmen at the gate, who were on the lookout, announce
us by a long, sinister cry, and we plunge
into a series of winding passageways and dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
recesses. Then come several small rooms with
low ceilings, which are stuffy, and lighted only by
dim, smoky lamps; their furnishings consist of a
divan and an arm-chair; the air, which is scarcely
breathable, is saturated with opium and musk.
The patron and the patroness have both the <i>embonpoint</i>
and the patriarchal good nature which
go along with such a house.</p>

<p>I beg that my reader will not misunderstand
me; this is a <i>house of song</i> (one of the oldest of
Chinese institutions, now tending to disappear),
and one comes here simply to listen to music,
surrounded by clouds of overpowering smoke.</p>

<p>Hesitatingly we take our places in one of the
small rooms, on a red couch covered with red
cushions embroidered with natural representations
of wild animals. Its cleanliness is dubious and
the excessive odors disturb us. On the papered
walls hang water-colors representing beatified
sages among the clouds. In one corner an old
German clock, which must have been in Pekin at
least a hundred years, ticks a shrill tick-tock. It
seems as though from the moment of our arrival
our minds were affected by the heavy opium
dreams that have been evolved on this divan
under the restraint of the oppressive dark ceilings;
and yet this is an elegant resort for the
Chinese, a place apart, to which, before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
war, no amount of money would admit any
European.</p>

<p>Pushing aside the long, poisonous pipes that
are offered us, we light some Turkish cigarettes,
and the music begins.</p>

<p>The first to appear is a guitarist, and as marvellous
a one as could be found at Granada or
Seville. He makes his strings weep songs of infinite
sadness.</p>

<p>Afterwards, for our amusement, he imitates on
his guitar the sound of a French regiment passing,
the muffled drums and the trumpets in the
distance playing the "March of the Zouaves."</p>

<p>Finally, three little old women appear, stout
and rather pale, who are to give us some plaintive
trios with minor strains that correspond with
the dreams that follow opium smoking. But before
beginning, one of the three, who is the star,&mdash;a
curious, very much dressed little creature,
with a tiara of rice-paper flowers, like a goddess,&mdash;advances
toward me on the toes of her tortured
feet, extends her hand to me in European
fashion, and says in French, with a Creole accent,
and not without a certain distinction of manner,
"Good evening, colonel."</p>

<p>It was the last thing I expected! Certainly the
occupation of Pekin by French troops has been
prolific in unexpected results.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Monday</span>, April 22.<br />
</div>

<p>My journey to the Tombs of the Emperors takes
some time to organize. The replies that come to
headquarters state that the country has been less
safe for the past few days, that bands of Boxers
have appeared in the province, and they are waiting
further instructions before consenting to my
departure.</p>

<p>In the meantime I make another visit in the
hot spring sunshine to the horrors of the Christian
cemeteries violated by the Chinese.</p>

<p>The confusion there is unchanged; there is the
same chaos of melancholy marbles, of mutilated
emblems, of steles fallen and broken. The human
remains which the Boxers did not have time to
destroy before they were routed lie in the same
places; no pious hand has ventured to bury them
again, for, according to Chinese ideas, it would
be accepting the proffered injury to put them
back in the ground; they must lie there, crying
for vengeance, until the day of complete reparation.
There is no change in this place of abomination,
except that it is no longer frozen; the sun
shines, and here and there yellow dandelions or
violet gillyflowers are blossoming in the sandy soil.</p>

<p>As to the great yawning wells which had been
filled with the bodies of the tortured, time has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
begun to do its work; the wind has blown the
dust and dirt over them, and their contents have
dried to such an extent that they now form a
compact gray mass, although an occasional foot
or hand or skull still protrudes above the rest.</p>

<p>In one of these wells, on the human crust that
rises nearly to the top of the ground, lies the body
of a poor Chinese baby, dressed in a torn little
shirt and swathed in red cotton,&mdash;it is a recent
corpse, hardly stiff as yet. No doubt it is a little
girl, for the Chinese have the most atrocious scorn
for girls; the Sisters pick them up like this along
the roads every day, thrown while still alive upon
some rubbish heap. So it was, no doubt, with this
one. She may have been ill, or ill-favored, or
simply one too many in a family. She lies there
face downward, with extended arms and little
doll-like hands. Her face, from which the blood
has been running, is lying on the most frightful
rubbish; a few of the feathers of a young sparrow
lie on the back of her neck, over which the flies
are meandering.</p>

<p>Poor little creature in her red woollen rags with
her little hands outstretched! Poor little face hidden
so that no one shall see it more before its final
decomposition!</p>

<h2>VII<br />
THE TOMBS OF THE EMPERORS</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Pekin</span>, Friday, April 26, 1901.<br />
</div>

<p>At last the day has come for my departure
for the sacred wood which encloses the
imperial tombs.</p>

<p>At seven o'clock in the morning I leave the
Palace of the North, taking with me my last autumn's
servants, Osman and Renaud, as well as
four African riflemen and a Chinese interpreter.
We start on horseback on animals chosen for the
journey, which will be transported by rail whenever
we are.</p>

<p>First, two or three kilometres across Pekin in
the beautiful morning light, along great thoroughfares
magnificent in their desolation, the route of
pageants and of emperors; through the triple red
gates, between lions of marble and obelisks of
marble, yellow as old ivory.</p>

<p>Now the railway station&mdash;it is in the centre
of the city at the foot of the wall of the second
enclosure, for the Western barbarians dared to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
commit the sacrilege of piercing the ramparts in
order to introduce their submersive system.</p>

<p>Men and horses go aboard. Then the train
threads its way across the devastated Chinese
City, and for three or four kilometres skirts the
colossal gray wall of the Tartar City, which continues
to unfold itself, always the same, with
the same bastions, the same battlements, without
a gate, without anything, to relieve its monotony
and its immensity.</p>

<p>A breach in the outer wall casts us forth at last
into the melancholy country.</p>

<p>And for three hours and a half it is a journey
through the dust of the plain, past demolished
stations, rubbish, ruins. According to the great
plans of the allied nations, this line, which actually
goes to Pao-Ting-Fu, is to be extended several
hundred leagues, so as to unite Pekin and
Hang-Chow, two enormous cities. It would thus
become one of the great arteries of new China,
scattering along its way the benefits of Occidental
civilization.</p>

<p>At noon we alight at Tchou-Tchou, a great
walled city, whose high battlemented ramparts
and two twelve-storied towers are perceived as
through a cloud of ashes. A man is scarcely recognizable
at twenty paces, as in times of fog in
the north, so filled with dust is the air; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
sun, though dimmed and yellow, reflects a heat
that is overpowering.</p>

<p>The commandant and the officers of the French
port, which has occupied Tchou-Tchou since the
autumn, were kind enough to meet me and to take
me for breakfast to their table in the comparative
freshness of the big dark pagodas where they with
their men were installed. The road to the tombs,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
they tell me, which latterly has seemed quite safe,
has been less so for a few days, a band of two
hundred marauding Boxers having yesterday attacked
one of the large villages through which I
must pass, where they fought all the morning,&mdash;until
the appearance of a French detachment who
came to the aid of the villagers sent the Boxers
flying like a flock of sparrows.</p>

<p>"Two hundred Boxers," continued the commandant
of the post, making a mental calculation;
"let me see, two hundred Boxers: you
will have to have at least ten men. You already
have six horsemen; I will, if you wish, add four
more."</p>

<p>I felt that I ought to make some suitable acknowledgment,
to reply that it was too much, that
he overpowered me. Then under the eyes of the
Buddhas, who were watching us breakfast, we
both began to laugh, struck all at once by the air
of extravagant bluster in what we were saying.
In truth it had the force of</p>

<div class="poem">
"Paraissez, Navarrois, Maures et Castillans;"<br />
</div>

<p>and yet, ten men against two hundred Boxers are
really all that are necessary. They are tenacious
and terrible only behind walls, those fellows; but
in a flat country&mdash;it is highly probable, moreover,
that I shall not see the queue of one. I accept
the reinforcement,&mdash;four brave soldiers, who
will be delighted to accompany me; I accept so
much the more readily, since my expedition will
thus take on the proportions of a military reconnaissance,
and this, it appears, will be a good
thing just now.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>
<p>At two o'clock we remount our horses, for we
are to sleep in an old walled town twenty-five kilometres
farther on, called Laï-Chow-Chien (Chinese
cities seem to claim these names; we know
of one called Cha-Ma-Miaou, and another, a very
large, ancient capital, Chien-Chien).</p>

<p>We make a plunge and disappear at once in a
cloud of dust which the wind chases over the plain,&mdash;the
immense, suffocating plain. There is no
illusion possible; it is the "yellow wind" which
has arisen,&mdash;a wind which generally blows in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
periods of three days, adding to the dust of China
all that of the Mongolian desert.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 900px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Chinese Village Carts, the only Vehicle used in the North of China</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>No roads but deep tracks, paths several feet
below the surface, which could only have been
hollowed there in the course of centuries. A
frightful country, which has, since the beginning
of time, endured torrid heat and almost hyperborean
cold. In this dry, powdery soil how can the
new wheat grow, which here and there makes
squares of really fresh green in the midst of the
infinite grays? There are also from time to time
a few sparse clumps of young elms and willows,
somewhat different from ours, but nevertheless
recognizable, just showing their first tiny leaves.
Monotony and sadness; one would call it a poor
landscape of the extreme north, lighted by an
African sun,&mdash;a sun that has mistaken the
latitude.</p>

<p>At a turn of the crooked road a band of
laborers who see us suddenly spring up, are
frightened, and throw down their spades to run
away. But one of them stops the others, crying,
"Fanko pink" (French soldiers). "They are
French, do not be afraid." Then they bend again
over the burning earth, and peaceably continue
their work, looking at us as we pass by from the
corners of their eyes. Their confidence speaks
volumes on the somewhat exceptional kind of
"barbarians" our brave soldiers have known how
to be, in the course of a European invasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>The few clumps of willows scattered over the
plains almost always shelter under their sparse
foliage the villages of tillers of the soil,&mdash;little
houses of clay and of gray brick, absurd little
pagodas, which are crumbling in the sunshine.
Warned by watchmen, men and children come
out as we pass to look at us in silence with naïve
curiosity; bare to the waist, very yellow, very
thin, and very muscular; pantaloons of the ever
similar dark blue cotton. Out of politeness each
one uncoils and allows to hang down his back his
long plaited hair, for to keep it on the crown of
the head would be a disrespect to me. No women;
they remain concealed. These people must have
much the same impression of us that the peasants
of Gaul had when Attila, chief of the army,
passed with his escort, except that they are less
frightened. Everything about us is astonishing,&mdash;costumes,
arms, and faces. Even my
horse, which is an Arabian stallion, must seem
to them a huge, unusual, superb animal beside
their own little horses, with their big rough
heads.</p>

<p>The frail willows, through which the sunlight
sifts upon the houses and tiny pagodas of these
primitive lives, scatter over us their blossoms, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
tiny feathers or little tufts of cotton-wool, which
fall in a shower, and mingle with the never-ending
dust.</p>

<p>On the plain, which now begins again, level and
always the same, I keep two or three hundred
metres in advance of my little armed troop, to
avoid the excessive dust raised by the trot of the
horses' feet; a gray cloud behind me when I turn
around shows me that they are following. The
"yellow wind" continues to blow; we are powdered
with it to such an extent that our horses,
our moustaches, our uniforms have become of the
color of ashes.</p>

<p>Toward five o'clock the old walled town where
we are to pass the night appears before us. From
afar it is almost imposing in the midst of the
plain, with its high crenellated ramparts so sombre
in color. Near by, no doubt, it would show but
ruin and decrepitude, like the rest of China.</p>

<p>A horseman, bringing along with him the inevitable
cloud of dust, comes out to meet me. It
is the officer commanding the fifty men of the
marine infantry who have occupied Laï-Chou-Chien
since October. He informs me that the
general has had the kindly thought of having me
announced as one of the great mandarins of Occidental
letters, so the mandarin of the town is coming
out to meet me with an escort, and he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
called together the neighboring villages for a fête
which he is preparing for me.</p>

<p>In fact, here the procession comes, from out the
crumbling old gates, advancing through the wasted
fields, with red emblems and music.</p>

<p>Now it stops to await me, ranged in two lines
on each side of the road. And following the usual
ceremonial, some one, a servant of the mandarin,
comes forward, fifty feet in advance of the others,
with a large red paper, which is the visiting-card
of his master. He himself, the timid mandarin,
awaits, standing, with the people of his house,
having come down from his palanquin out of
deference. I extend my hand without dismounting,
as I have been told to do, after which, in
a cloud of gray dust, we make our way toward
the great walls, followed by my cavaliers, and
preceded by the procession of honor with music
and emblems.</p>

<p>At the head are two big red parasols, surrounded
with a fall of silk like the canopies in a procession;
than a fantastic black butterfly, as large as an owl
with extended wings, which is carried at the end
of a stick by a child; then two rows of banners;
then shields of red lacquered wood inscribed with
letters of gold. As soon as we begin to march
gongs commence to sound lugubriously at regular
intervals as for a military salute, whilst heralds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
with prolonged cries announce my arrival to the
inhabitants of the village.</p>

<p>Here we are at the gate, which seems like the
entrance to a cavern; on each side are hung five
or six little wooden cages, each one containing a
kind of black beast, motionless in the midst of a
swarm of flies; their tails may be seen hanging
outside the bars like dead things. What can it be
that keeps itself rolled up like a ball, and has such
a long tail? Monkeys? Ah, horrors, they are
heads that have been severed from their bodies!
Each one of these pretty cages contains a human
head, beginning to grow black in the sunshine,
with long, braided hair which has been intentionally
uncoiled.</p>

<p>We are swallowed up by the big gate, and are
received by the inevitable grinning old granite
monsters which at right and at left raise their
great heads with the squinting eyes. Motionless,
against the inner wall of the tunnel, the people
press to see me pass, huddled together, climbing
one upon the other,&mdash;yellow nakedness, blue cotton
rags, ugly faces. The dust fills and obscures this
vaulted passage where men and horses press, enveloped
in the same gloom.</p>

<p>We have entered old provincial China, belonging
to another era entirely unknown to us.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Ruin and dilapidation within the walls, as I expected,
not from any fault of the Boxers or of
the Allies, for the war did not come near here,
but as a result of decay, of the falling into dust
of this old China, our elder by more than thirty
centuries.</p>

<p>The gong in front of me continues to sound
lugubriously at fixed intervals, and the heralds continue
to announce me to the people by prolonged
cries, resounding through the little powdery streets
under the still burning evening sun. One sees
unused land and cultivated fields. Here and
there granite monsters, defaced, shapeless, half
buried, worn by years, indicate what was formerly
the entrance to a palace.</p>

<p>Before a door which surmounts a tricolored
pavilion the procession stops, and I dismount. For
seven or eight months our fifty soldiers of the
marine infantry have been quartered here, spending
a whole long winter at Laï-Chou-Chien, separated
from the rest of the world by snow and
icy steppes, and leading a Crusoe-like existence
in the midst of the most perplexing surroundings.</p>

<p>It is a surprise and a joy to come among them,
to see again their honest home faces, after all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
yellow ones we have met along the road, darting
sharp enigmatical glances at us. This French
quarter is like a bit of life, gaiety, and youth in
the midst of mummified old China.</p>

<p>It is plain that the winter has been good for our
soldiers, for the look of health is on their cheeks.
They have organized themselves with a comical
and somewhat marvellous ingenuity, creating lavatories,
douche rooms, a schoolroom where they
teach French to the little Chinese, and even a
theatre. Living in intimate comradeship with the
people of the town, who will before long be unwilling
to see them go, they cultivate vegetable gardens,
raise chickens and sheep, and bring up little
ravens by hand like orphan babies.</p>

<p>It is arranged that I should sleep at the house of
the mandarin after having supped at the French
post. So at nine o'clock they come for me to
conduct me to the "Yamen" with lanterns of state,
decorated in a very Chinese fashion and as big as
barrels.</p>

<p>The Chinese Yamen is always of tremendous
extent. In the cool night air, picking my way by
the light of lanterns, amongst huge stones and between
rows of servants, I pass through a series of
courts two hundred metres long, with I don't
know how many ruined porticoes and peristyles
with shaky steps, before reaching the crumbling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
and dusty lodging which the mandarin intends for
me,&mdash;a separate building in the midst of a sort
of yard, and surrounded by old trees with shapeless
trunks. There, under the smoky rafters, I
have a great room, with whitewashed walls, containing
in the centre a platform with seats like a
throne, also some heavy ebony arm-chairs; and as
wall decorations some rolls of silk spread out, on
which poetry, in Manchou characters, is written.
In the wing on the left is a small bedroom for my
two servants, and on the right one for me with
window-panes of rice paper. On a platform is
a very hard bed with covers of red silk, and, lastly,
an incense burner, in which little sticks of incense
are burning. All this is rural, naïve, and superannuated,
antiquated even for China.</p>

<p>My timid host, in ceremonial costume, awaits
me at the entrance, and makes me take a seat with
him on the central throne, where he offers me the
obligatory tea in porcelain a hundred years old.
Then he had the discretion to bring the audience
to a close and to bid me good-night. As he withdrew
he told me not to be disturbed if I heard a
good deal of coming and going over my head, as
the space above was frequented by rats. Neither
was I to be disturbed if I heard on the other side
of my paper window-panes people walking up and
down in the yard playing castanets; they would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
be the night watchmen, thus informing me that
they were not asleep, and were doing their duty.</p>

<p>"There are many brigands in this country," he
added; "the city with its high walls closes its
gates at sunset, but the workmen going to the
fields before daybreak have made a hole in the ramparts,&mdash;this
the brigands have discovered, and
do not hesitate to enter by it."</p>

<p>When this deep-bowing mandarin was gone,
and I was alone in the darkness of my dwelling,
in the heart of an isolated city whose gates were
guarded by human heads in cages, I felt myself
at an infinite distance away, separated from my
own world by immense space as well as by time,
by ages; it seemed to me that I was going to
sleep amongst a people at least a thousand years
behind our era.</p>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Saturday</span>, April 27.<br />
</div>

<p>The crowing of cocks, the singing of little birds
on my roof, awoke me in my strange old room;
and by the light that came in through my paper
panes I guessed that the warm sun was shining out
of doors.</p>

<p>Osman and Renaud, who were up before me,
came to tell me that they were hurriedly making
great preparations in the courtyard of the Yamen
in order to give me a fête, a morning fête, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
we had to continue our route to the imperial tombs
soon after the mid-day meal.</p>

<p>It began about nine o'clock. I was given a seat
in an arm-chair beside the mandarin, who seemed
weighed down beneath his silken gowns. In front
of me, in the dazzling sunshine, was the series of
courts with porticoes of irregular outline and old
monsters on pedestals. A crowd of Chinese&mdash;always
the men alone, it is understood&mdash;have
assembled in their eternal blue rags. The yellow
wind which had died down at night, as usual,
begins to blow again, and to whiten the heavens
with dust. The acacias and the monotonous willows,
which are almost the only trees scattered
over this northern China, show here and there on
their slender old branches little pale-green leaves
just barely out.</p>

<p>First comes the slow, the very slow, passing of
a band with many gongs, cymbals, and bells all
muffled; the melody seems to be carried by a sweet,
melancholy, and persistent unison of flutes,&mdash;large
flutes, with a deep tone, some of which have several
tubes, and resemble sheaves of wheat. It is sweet
and lulling, exquisite to hear.</p>

<p>Now the musicians seat themselves near us, in
a circle, to open the fête. All at once the rhythm
changes, grows more rapid, and becomes a dance.
Then from afar, from the retirement of the courts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
and the old porticoes, one sees above the heads of
the crowd, through the dust that grows thicker
and thicker, a troop of dancing creatures two or
three times taller than men, swinging along, swinging
in regular time and playing citherns, fanning
themselves, and comporting themselves generally
in an exaggerated, nervous epileptic manner.&mdash;Giants?
Jumping Jacks? What can they be?
They are approaching rapidly with long, leaping
steps, and here they are in front of us. Ah, they
are on stilts, enormously high stilts. They are
taller on their wooden legs than the shepherds
of the Landes, and they hop like big grasshoppers.
They are in costume and made up,&mdash;painted,
rouged. They have wigs, false beards; they represent
gods, genii such as one sees on old pagodas;
they represent princesses also, with beautiful robes
of embroidered silk, with cheeks too pink and
white, and with artificial flowers in their chignons,&mdash;princesses
all very tall, fanning themselves in an
exaggerated way, and swinging along like the rest
of the company, with the same regular, continuous
movement, as persistent as the pendulum of a
clock.</p>

<p>All these stilt-walkers, it seems, are merely
young men of a neighboring village, who have
formed themselves into a gymnastic society, and
who do this for amusement. In the smallest villages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
in the interior of China, centuries, yes, thousands
of years, before the custom reached us, the
men&mdash;fathers and sons&mdash;began to devote themselves
passionately to feats of strength and skill,
founding rival societies, some becoming acrobats,
others balancers, or jugglers, and organizing contests.
It is especially during the long winters that
they exercise, when all is frozen, and when each
little human group must live alone in the midst of
a desert of snow.</p>

<p>In fact, in spite of their white wigs and their
centenarian beards, it is obvious that all these
people are young, very young, with childlike smiles.
They smile naïvely, these droll, pleasant princesses
with the over-long legs, whose fan motions are so
excited and who dance more and more disjointedly,
bending, reversing, and shaking their heads and
their bodies in a frenzy. They smile naïvely, these
old men with children's faces; they play the cithern
or the tambourine as though they were possessed.
The persistent unison of the flutes seems to bewitch
them, to put them into a special condition
of madness, expressed by more and more convulsive
movements.</p>

<p>At a given signal each one stands on a single
stilt, the other leg raised, the second stilt thrown
back over the shoulder; and by prodigies of balancing
they dance harder than ever, like marionettes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
whose springs are out of order, whose
mechanism is about to break down. Then bars
two metres high are brought in, and they jump
over them, every one taking part, including the
princesses, the old men, and the genii, all keeping
up an incessant play of fans and a beating of
tambourines.</p>

<p>At last, when they can hold out no longer and
go and lean against the porticoes among the old
acacias and willows, another company just like
the first comes forward and begins again, to the
same tune, a similar dance. They represent the
same persons, the same genii, the same long-bearded
gods, the same beautiful mincing dames.
In their accoutrements, so unknown to us, and with
their curiously wrinkled faces, these dancers are
the incarnation of ancient mythological dreams
dreamed long ago in the dark ages by human
beings at an infinite distance from us; and these
customs are handed down from generation to
generation, and from one end of the country
to the other in that unchanging way in which
rites, forms, and property in China are invariably
transmitted.</p>

<p>This fête, this dance, extremely novel as it is,
retains its village, its rustic character, and is as
simple as any truly rural entertainment.</p>

<p>They finally cease jumping the bars, and now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
two terrible beasts come forth, one red and one
green. They are big, heraldic dragons at least
twenty metres long, with the raised heads, the
yawning mouths, the horns, and claws, and horrible
squinting eyes that everybody knows. They
advance rapidly, throwing themselves onto the
shoulders of the crowd with the undulations of a
reptile; they are light, however, made of pasteboard,
covered with some sort of stuff, and each
beast is supported in the air by means of sticks, by
a dozen skilful young men who have a subtle knack
of giving to their movements a serpentine effect.
A sort of master of the ballet precedes them,
holding in his hand a ball which they never lose
sight of, and which he uses as the leader of an
orchestra uses his baton, to guide the writhings
of the monsters.</p>

<p>The two great creatures content themselves with
dancing before me, to the sound of flutes and
gongs, in the centre of the circle of Chinese, which
is extended in order to make room for them. At
length the struggle becomes quite terrible, while
the gongs and cymbals rage. They become entangled,
they roll on top of one another, they drag
their long rings in the dust, and then, all at once,
with a bound they get up, as though in a passion,
and stand shaking their enormous heads at one
another, trembling with rage. The ballet master,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
nervously moving his director's ball, throws himself
about and rolls his ferocious eyes.</p>

<p>The dust on the crowd grows thicker and thicker,
and on the invisible dragon-bearers; it rises in
clouds, rendering this battle between the red beast
and the green beast almost fantastic. The sun
burns as in a tropical country, and yet the sad
Chinese April, anæmic from such a drought following
the frozen winter, is barely heralded by
the tender color of the few tiny leaves on the old
willows and acacias of the court.</p>

<p>After breakfast some of the mandarins of the
plain from the neighboring villages arrive, preceded
by music and bringing me pastoral offerings,&mdash;baskets
of preserved grapes, baskets of pears,
live chickens in cages, and a jar of rice-wine.
They wear the official winter head-dress, with a
raven's quill, and have on gowns of dark silk with
squares of gold embroidery, in the centre of which
is depicted, surrounded by clouds, the invariable
stork flying toward the moon. They are nearly all
dried-up old men with gray beards and drooping
gray moustaches. We have great <i>tchinchins</i> with
them, profound bows, extravagant compliments,
handshakings in which one feels the scratch of
over-long nails, the touch of thin old fingers.</p>

<p>At two o'clock I remount with my men and start
off through the dilapidated streets, preceded by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
same procession as upon my arrival. The gongs
are muffled, the heralds sound their cries. Behind
me my host, the mandarin, follows in his palanquin,
accompanied by the troop on stilts and by the
enormous dragons.</p>

<p>As we leave the village, and enter the deep tunnelled
gateway where the crowd is already assembled
to see us, the whole procession is engulfed
with us,&mdash;the long, striding princesses, the gods
who play the cithern or the tambourine, the red
beast, and the green beast. In the semi-obscurity
of the arched way, to the noise of all the citherns
and of all the gongs, in the clouds of black dust
which blind us, there is a compact <i>mêlée</i>, where our
horses prance and jump, troubled by the noise and
terrified by the two frightful monsters undulating
above our heads.</p>

<p>After conducting us a quarter of a league beyond
the walls, the procession leaves us at last, and we
find silence again on the burning plain, where we
have about twenty kilometres to go through the
dust and the "yellow wind" before reaching
Y-Tchou, another old walled city which is to be
our halting-place for the night.</p>

<p>Not until to-morrow do we arrive at the tombs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<h3>III</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 900px;">
<img src="images/i289.jpg" width="900" height="558" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Chinese Peasant cultivating Rice Fields with Native Plow</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>The plain resembles that of yesterday, yet it is a
little more green and wooded. The wheat, sown
in rows, as with us, grows miraculously in this
soil, made up of dust and cinders though it apparently
is. Everything seems less desolate as one
gets farther away from the region of Pekin, and
ascends almost imperceptibly towards those great
mountains of the west, which are appearing with
greater and greater distinctness in front of us.
The "yellow wind," too, blows with less severity,
and when it dies down for a few moments, when
the blinding dust decreases, it is like the country
in the north of France, with its ploughed fields
and clumps of elms and willows. One forgets
that this is the heart of China, on the other side
of the globe, and one expects to see peasants from
home pass along the paths. But the few toilers
who are bending over the earth have long braids,
coiled about their heads like crowns, and their
bare backs are saffron-colored.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>All is peace in these sunshine-flooded fields, in
these villages built in the scanty shade of the willows.
The people seem to live happily, cultivating
the friendly soil in primitive fashion, guided by
the customs of five thousand years ago. Aside
from the possible exactions of a few mandarins,&mdash;and
there are many who are kind,&mdash;these
Chinese peasants still live in the Golden Age, and
I can hardly conceive of their accepting the joys
of the "New China" dreamed of by Occidental
reformers. Up to this time, it is true, the invasion
has scarcely reached them; in this part of
the country, occupied solely by the French, our
troops have never played any other rôle than
that of defender of the villagers against pillaging
Boxers. Ploughing, sowing, all the work of the
fields, has been quietly done in season, and it is
impossible not to be struck with the very different
look of other parts of the country which I will not
designate, where there has been a reign of terror,
and where the fields have been destroyed and have
become desert steppes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At about half-past four, against a background
of mountains which are beginning to look tall to
us, a village appears, the first sight of which, like
that of yesterday, is rather formidable with its
high crenellated ramparts.</p>

<p>A horseman comes out to meet me once more,
like yesterday, and again it is the captain in command
of the post of marine infantry stationed
there since last autumn.</p>

<p>Watchers stationed on the walls have perceived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
us from afar by the cloud of dust our horses raise
on the plain. As soon as we approach we see
emerging from the old gates the official procession
coming to meet us, with the same emblems
as at Laï-Chou-Chien,&mdash;the same big butterfly,
the same red parasols, the same shields and banners.
Each Chinese ceremonial has been for centuries
regulated by unvarying usages.</p>

<p>However, the people who receive me to-day are
much more elegant and undoubtedly richer than
those of yesterday. The mandarin, who comes
down from his sedan chair to await me at the side
of the road, having sent his red paper visiting-card
on before him a hundred feet or so, stands
surrounded by a group of important-looking persons
in sumptuous silk robes. He himself is a
distinguished-looking old man, who wears in his
hat the peacock feather and the sapphire button.
There is an enormous crowd waiting to see me
make my entrance to the funereal sound of the
gongs and the prolonged cries of the heralds. On
the top of the ramparts figures may be seen peering
through the battlements with their small
oblique eyes, and even in the dim gateways double
rows of yellow men crowd against the walls. My
interpreter confesses, however, that there is a general
disappointment. "If he is a man of letters,"
they ask, "why is he dressed like a colonel?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
(The scorn of the Chinese for the military profession
is well known.) My horse, however, somewhat
restores my prestige. Tired as the poor
Algerian animal is, he still has a certain carriage of
the head and tail when he feels that he is observed,
and especially if he hears the sound of the gong.</p>

<p>Y-Tchou, the city wherein we find ourselves,
shut in by walls thirty feet high, still contains fifteen
thousand inhabitants in spite of its deserted
districts and its ruins. There is a great crowd
along our route, in all the little streets and in
front of the little old shops where antediluvian
occupations are carried on. It was from this
very place that the terrible movement of hatred
against foreigners was launched last year. In a
convent of Bonze nuns in the neighboring mountain
the war of extermination was first preached,
and these people who receive me so kindly were
the first Boxers. Ardent converts for the moment
to the French cause, they cheerfully decapitate
those of their own people who refuse to come to
terms, and put their heads in the little cages which
adorn the gates of their city; but if the wind
should change to-morrow, I should see myself cut
up by them to the tune of the same old gongs and
with the same enthusiasm which they put into my
reception. When I have taken possession of the
house set apart for me, back of the residence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
the mandarin at the end of an interminable avenue
of old porticoes, and monsters who show me their
teeth in tiger-like smiles, a half-hour of daylight
still remains, and I go to pay a visit to a
young prince of the imperial family, stationed at
Y-Tchou in the interests of the venerable tombs.</p>

<p>First comes his garden, melancholy in the April
twilight. It lies between walls of gray brick, and
is very much shut in for a town already so walled.
Gray also is the rockwork outlining the small
squares or lozenges, where big red, lavender, and
pink peonies flourish. These, unlike our own, are
very fragrant, and to-night fill the air of this
gloomy enclosure with an excessive odor. There
are also rows of little porcelain jars inhabited by
tiny fish&mdash;regular monstrosities&mdash;red fish or
black fish with cumbersome fins and extravagant
tails, giving the effect of a flounced petticoat;
fish with enormous terrifying eyes, which protrude
like those of the heraldic dragons and which
are the result of I do not know what mysterious
form of breeding. The Chinese, who torture the
feet of their women, also deform their trees, so
that they remain dwarfed and crooked. They
train their fruits to resemble animals, and their
animals to look like the chimæras of a dream.</p>

<p>It is already dark in the prince's apartment,
which looks out on this prison-like garden, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
one sees little, on first entering, but draperies of
red silk, long canopies falling from numerous
"parasols of honor," which are open and standing
upright on wooden supports. The air is heavy,
saturated with opium and musk. There are deep
red divans with silver pipes lying about for smoking
the poison of which China is in a fair way to
perish. The prince, who is twenty or twenty-two
years old, is of a sickly ugliness, with divergent
eyes; he is perfumed to excess, and dressed in
pale silk in tones of mauve or lilac.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the evening dinner with the mandarin, where
the commandant of the French post, the prince,
two or three notables, and one of my "confrères,"
a member of the Academy of China,&mdash;a mandarin
with a sapphire button,&mdash;are the guests.
Seated in heavy square arm-chairs, there are six
or seven of us around a table decorated with small,
exquisite, and unusual bits of old porcelain, so
tiny as to seem to be part of a doll service. Red
candles in high copper chandeliers give us our
light.</p>

<p>This very morning the entire province had
orders to leave off the winter head-dress and to
put on the summer one,&mdash;a conical affair, resembling
a lamp-shade, from which fall tufts of
reddish horse-hair or peacock's or crow's feathers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
according to the rank of the wearer. And since
it is the style to wear them at dinner, hats of this
description make grotesque figures of the guests.</p>

<p>As for the ladies of the house, they, alas, remain
invisible, and it would be the worst possible
breach of good form to ask for them or to refer
to them in any way. It is well known that a
Chinaman compelled to speak of his wife must
refer to her in an indirect way, using, whenever
possible, a qualifying term, devoid of all compliment,
as, for example, "my offensive" or "my
nauseating" wife.</p>

<p>The dinner begins with preserved prunellas and
a great variety of dainty sweetmeats, which are
eaten with little chop-sticks. The mandarin makes
excuses for not offering me sea-swallows' nests, but
Y-Tchou is so far from the coast that it is difficult
to secure what one would like. But to make
up for this lack, there is a dish of sharks' fins,
another of the bladder of the sperm whale, another
still of hinds' nerves, besides a ragout of water-lily
roots with shrimps' eggs.</p>

<p>The inevitable odor of opium and musk mingled
with the flavor of strange sauces pervades the
room, which is white with a black ceiling. Its
walls are decorated with water-colors on long
strips of precious yellow paper, containing representations
of animals or of huge flowers. A score<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
of servants flock about us with the same sort of
head-dress as their masters, and clad in beautiful
silk gowns with velvet corselets. At my right my
"confrère" of the Chinese Academy discourses
to me of another world. He is old and quite
withered-looking from the abuse of the fatal drug;
his small face, shrivelled to a mere nothing, is
obliterated by his conical hat and by his big blue
goggles.</p>

<p>"Is it true," he inquires, "that the Middle Empire
occupies the top of the territorial globe, and
that Europe hangs on one side at an uncomfortable
angle?"</p>

<p>It appears that he has at the ends of his fingers
more than forty thousand characters in writing,
and that he is able to improvise sweet poetry on
any subject you may choose. From time to time
I am aghast at the sight of his skeleton-like arm
emerging from sleeves like pagodas, and stretching
out toward some dish. His object is to secure
with his own two-tined fork some choice morsel
for me, which compels me to resort to perpetual
and difficult jugglery in order not to have to eat
the things.</p>

<p>After several preposterous light dishes, boned
ducks appear, then a copious variety of viands
succeed one another until the guests announce
that they really have had enough. Then they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
bring opium pipes and cigarettes, and soon it is
time to take a palanquin for the nocturnal festival
they are arranging for me.</p>

<p>Outside, in the long avenue of porticoes, under
the starry sky, all the servants of the Yamen await
us with big paper lanterns, painted with bats and
chimæras. A hundred friendly Boxers are also
there, holding torches to light us better. Each of
us gets into a palanquin, and the bearers trot off
with us, while flaming torches run along beside
us, and gongs, also running, begin the noise of
battle at the head of our procession.</p>

<p>By the light of dancing torches we file rapidly
past the open stalls, past the groups of natives
assembled to watch us, past the grimacing monsters
ranged along our route.</p>

<p>At the rear of an immense court stands a new
building, where by the light of the torches we
read the astonishing inscription, "Parisiana of
Y-Tchou." "Parisiana" in this ultra-Chinese
town, which until the previous autumn had never
seen a European approach its walls! Our bearers
stop there, and we find it is a theatre improvised
this winter by our sixty soldiers to help pass away
the glacial evenings.</p>

<p>I had promised to assist at a gala performance
given for me by these grown-up children this evening.
And of all the charming receptions that have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
been tendered me here and there all over the world,
none has moved me more than this one arranged
by a few soldiers exiled in a lost corner of China.
Their reserved smiles of welcome, the few words
one of them undertook to say for all, were more
touching than any banquet or formal address, and
I was glad to press the hands of the brave soldiers
who dared not offer them.</p>

<p>In order that I might have a souvenir of their
evening's hospitality at Y-Tchou, they got up a
subscription and presented me with a very local
gift,&mdash;one of those red silk parasols with long
falling draperies, which it is the custom in China
to carry in front of men of mark. And cumbrous
as the thing is, even when folded, it is needless to
say that I shall take it with great care to France.</p>

<p>They next gave me an illustrated programme,
on which the name of each actor figured, followed
by a pompous title,&mdash;"Monsieur the soldier so-and-so
of the Comédie-Française," or "Monsieur
the corporal so-and-so of the Théâtre Sarah-Bernhardt."
We take our places. It is a real theatre
that they have made, with a raised stage, scenery,
and a curtain.</p>

<p>In the Chinese arm-chairs, which are placed in
the first row, their captain is seated next to me;
then come the mandarin, the prince of the blood,
and two or three other notables, with long queues.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
Behind us are the under-officers and the soldiers;
several yellow babies in ceremonial toilettes mingle
familiarly with them, even climbing up on their
knees. They are pupils from their school. For
they have started a school, like the one at Laï-Chou-Chien,
to teach French to the children of
the neighborhood. A sergeant presented me to
an inimitable youngster of not more than six,
dressed for the occasion in a beautiful gown, his
little short, thick queue tied with red silk, who
recited for me the beginning of "Maître corbeau
sur un arbre perché," in a deep voice, rolling his
eyes to the ceiling the while.</p>

<p>Three taps and the curtain rises. First comes
a farce, by I know not whom, but certainly much
retouched by themselves with an unexpected turn
of wit which is irresistible. The ladies, the
mothers-in-law, with false hair made of oakum,
are indescribable. Then more comic scenes and
songs from the "Black Cat." The Chinese guests
on their throne-like chairs remain as impassive as
the Buddhas of the pagodas. What do their Asiatic
brains make of all this French gaiety?</p>

<p>Before the last numbers on the programme are
over the sudden thundering of gongs is heard
outside, the playing of citherns, and the clashing
of cymbals, and of all the rest of the iron instruments
of China. It is the prelude to the fête<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
which the mandarin is to give me, which is to
take place in the courtyard of the army quarters,
and in which our soldiers naturally are to take
part.</p>

<p>A profusion of lanterns illumines the court,
together with the flaming torches of a hundred
Boxers. First there is a stilt dance, then follow
all the gymnastic societies of the adjoining district
in their specialties. Little country boys
twelve years old, costumed like lords of old dynasties,
have a sham battle, flourishing their
swords and jumping about like kittens, prodigies
of quickness and lightness. Then come the young
men of another village, who throw off their garments
and begin to twirl pitchforks all around
their naked bodies; by a twist of the wrist or by
an imperceptible movement of the foot they are
turned so rapidly that very soon they are no
longer forks to our eyes, but a row of endless
serpents about the breasts of the men. Then suddenly,
more deftly than in the best managed circus,
a horizontal bar is placed before us, and acrobats,
naked to the waist, and superbly muscular, give a
performance. They belong to the mandarin, and
are the very men who just now served us at the
table in beautiful silken robes.</p>

<p>It all ended with very long and noisy fireworks.
When the pieces attached to invisible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
bamboo stems exploded in the air, delicate and
luminous paper pagodas floated off across the
starry sky, fabrics of a Chinese dream, trembling,
imponderable, which suddenly took fire and
disappeared in smoke.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is late when we return through the little dark
streets, now all asleep. Our bearers trot along, escorted
by a thousand dancing lights from torches
and lanterns.</p>

<p>Toward midnight I am at last alone, in the
depths of the Yamen, in my separate dwelling,
the avenue leading to it guarded by motionless,
crouching beasts. On my centre-table they have
placed a luncheon of all the kinds of cakes known
to China. Trees in fruit, in flower, and without
leaves, decorate my small tables,&mdash;dwarf trees,
of course, grown in porcelain jars, and so tortured
as to become unnatural. A little pear-tree has
assumed the regular form of a lyre composed of
white blossoms; a small peach-tree resembles a
crown made of pink flowers. Everything in my
room, except these fresh spring plants, is old,
warped, worm-eaten, and at the holes in a ceiling
that was once white appear the faces of innumerable
rats, whose eyes follow me about the room.
As soon as I put out my light and lie down in my
great bed with carvings representing horrible animals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
I hear all these rats come down, move about
among the fine porcelains, and gnaw at my cakes.
Then from out the more and more profound stillness
of my surroundings the night watchmen with
muffled steps begin discreetly to use their castanets.</p>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Sunday</span>, April 28.<br />
</div>

<p>An early morning walk among the silver-sculptors
of Y-Tchou, then through a quite dead part
of the town to an antique pagoda half crumbled
away, which stands among some phantom trees
of which little but the bark is left. Along its
galleries the tortures of the Buddhist hell are depicted;
several hundred life-sized persons carved
in wood filled with worm-holes, are fighting with
devils who are tearing them to pieces or burning
them alive.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At nine o'clock I mount my horse and start off
with my men, in order to cover before noon the
fifteen or eighteen kilometres which still separate
me from the mysterious burial-places of the emperors;
for we return to Y-Tchou for the night,
and set off again to-morrow on the road to Pekin.</p>

<p>We go out at the gate opposite the one we entered
yesterday. Nowhere else have we seen so
many monsters as in this ancient town; their great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
sneering faces appear on all sides out of the ground,
where time has almost buried them. A few entire
figures may be seen crouching on their pedestals,
guarding the approaches to the granite bridges or
ranged in rows around the squares.</p>

<p>As we leave the town, we pass a poor-looking
pagoda on whose walls hang cages containing
human heads recently cut off. And then we find
ourselves once more in the silent fields under the
burning sun.</p>

<p>The prince accompanies us, riding a Mongolian
colt as rough-coated as a spaniel. His rose-colored
silks and velvet foot-gear form a striking contrast
to our rough costumes and dusty boots, and he
leaves behind him a trail of musk.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The country slopes gently toward the range of
Mongolian mountains, which, though still some
distance ahead of us, is now growing rapidly in
height. Trees are more and more frequent, grass
grows naturally here and there, and we have left
the dreary ashy soil.</p>

<p>Near by there are a few pointed-topped hills,
queerly shaped, with occasionally an old tower
perched on the summit,&mdash;the ten or twelve storied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
kind, which at once give the landscape a Chinese
look, with superimposed roofs, curved up like dogs'
ears, at the corners, with an Æolian harp at each
end.</p>

<p>The air is growing purer; the cloud of dust is
left behind as we approach the unquestionably
privileged region which has been selected for the
repose of the celestial emperors and empresses.</p>

<p>We stop at a village, after about a dozen kilometres,
to take breakfast with a great prince of
much higher rank than the one who rides with
us. He is a direct uncle of the Emperor, in disgrace
with the Empress, whose favorite he has
been, and now entrusted with the guardianship of
the tombs. As he is in deep mourning, he is
dressed in cotton like the poor, and yet does not
resemble them. He makes excuses for receiving
us in a dilapidated old house, his own Yamen
having been burned by the Germans, and offers us
a very Chinese breakfast, where reappear the
sharks' wings and hinds' nerves. The flat-faced
peasants of the neighborhood peer at us in the
meantime through the numerous holes in the rice-paper
window-panes.</p>

<p>We remount at once, after the last cup of tea,
to visit the tombs toward which we have been journeying
for three days, and which are now very
near. My confrère of the Pekin Academy, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
his big, round spectacles and his little bird-like
body completely lost in his beautiful silken robes,
has rejoined us, and slowly follows along upon a
mule.</p>

<p>A more and more solitary country. No more
villages, no more fields! The road winds along
among the hills,&mdash;which are covered with grass
and flowers,&mdash;surprising and enchanting our unaccustomed
eyes. It seems like a glimpse of Eden
after the dusty-gray China we have come through,
where the only green thing was the wheat. The
perpetual dust of Petchili has been left behind;
but on the plain below we still perceive it, like a
fog from which we have escaped.</p>

<p>We continue to mount, and soon arrive at the
first spurs of the Mongolian range. Here behind a
wall of earth we find an immense Tartar camp, at
least two thousand men, armed with lances, bows,
and arrows, guard of honor of the defunct rulers.</p>

<p>Once more we see a clear horizon, the very
memory of which had faded. It seems as though
these Mongolian mountains suddenly huddled together
as though they had all pressed forward;
very rocky they are, with strange outlines, peaks
like turrets or pagoda-towers rising above us,&mdash;all
of a beautiful purple iris effect.</p>

<p>Ahead of us we begin to see on all sides wooded
valleys and forests of cedar. True, they are artificial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
forests, although very old,&mdash;planted centuries
ago for this funeral park, covering an area twenty
miles in circumference, where four Tartar emperors
sleep.</p>

<p>We enter this silent, shadowy place, astonished
to find that, contrary to Chinese custom, it is surrounded
by no wall. No doubt it was felt that this
isolated spot would be sufficiently protected by the
terror inspired by the shades of the emperors, as
well as by a general edict of death promulgated in
advance against any one who dared to cultivate a
bit of the ground or even sow a seed.</p>

<p>It is the sacred wood <i>par excellence</i>, with all its
retirement and its mystery. What marvellous
poets of the dead the Chinese are, to be able to
prepare them such dwelling-places!</p>

<p>Here in the shadows one is tempted to speak
low, as under the roof of a temple; one feels it a
profanity for the horses to trample down the turf,&mdash;a
carpet of fine grass and blossoms, venerated
for ages past, and apparently never disturbed. The
great cedars and the hundred-year-old thuyas,
scattered over the hills and in the valleys, are separated
by open spaces where brushwood grows;
and under the colonnade formed by their massive
trunks there is nothing but short grass, exquisite
tiny flowers, and moss and lichens.</p>

<p>The dust that obscures the sky on the plains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
apparently never reaches this chosen spot, for the
magnificent green of the trees is nowhere dimmed.
In this superb solitude, which men have created
here and dedicated to the shades of their masters,
the distance disclosed to us as our road takes us
past some clearing or up some height is of an
absolute limpidity. A light as from Paradise falls
upon us from a heaven profoundly blue, streaked
with tiny clouds, rose-gray like turtle-doves. At
such moments one gets a glimpse of splendid distant
golden-yellow roofs rising amongst sombre
branches, like the palace of the Sleeping Beauty.</p>

<p>Not a soul in all this shaded road. The silence
of the desert! Only occasionally the croaking of
a raven,&mdash;too funereal a bird, it seems, for the
calm enchantment of this place, where Death is
compelled, before entering, to lay aside its horror
and to become simply the magician of unending
rest.</p>

<p>In some places the trees form avenues which are
finally lost to sight in the green dusk. Elsewhere
they have been planted without design, and seem
to have grown of their own accord and to form a
natural forest. All the details recall the fact that
the place is magnificent, imperial, sacred; the
smallest bridge, thrown over a stream which
crosses the road, is of white marble of rare design,
covered with beautiful carvings; an heraldic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
beast, crouching in the shadow, menaces us with
a ferocious smile as we pass by, or a marble obelisk
surrounded by five-clawed dragons rises unexpectedly
in its snowy whiteness, outlined against
the dark background of the cedars.</p>

<p>In this wood, twenty miles in circumference, lie
the bodies of but four emperors; that of the Empress
Regent, whose tomb was long since begun,
will be added as well as her son's, the young Emperor,
who has had his chosen place marked with
a stele of gray marble.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> And that is all. Other
sovereigns, past or to be, sleep, or will sleep, elsewhere,
in other Edens, as vast and as wonderfully
arranged. Immense space is required for the body
of a Son of Heaven, and immense solitary silence
must reign round about it.</p>

<p>The arrangement of these tombs is regulated by
unchangeable plans, which date back to old extinguished
dynasties. They are all alike, recalling
those of the Ming emperors, which antedate them
by several centuries, and whose ruins have been
for a long time the object of one of the excursions
permitted to European travellers.</p>

<p>One invariably approaches by a cut in the sombre
forest, half a mile in length, which has been so
planned by the artists of the past that it opens, like
the doors of a magnificent stage-setting, upon
some incomparable background such as a particularly
high mountain, abrupt and bold, or a mass
of rock presenting one of those anomalies of form
and color that the Chinese everywhere seek.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>
<p>Invariably, also, the avenue begins with great
triumphal arches of white marble, which are, needless
to say, surmounted by monsters bristling with
horns and claws.</p>

<p>In the case of the ancestor of the present Emperor,
who receives to-day our first visit, these
entrance arches appear unexpectedly in the heart
of the forest, their bases entangled with wild bindweed.
They seem to have shot up, at the rubbing
of an enchanter's magic ring, out of what appears
to be virgin soil, so covered is it with moss and
with the rare delicate little plants which nothing
disturbs, and which grow only in places that have
long been quiet and respected by man.</p>

<p>Next come some marble bridges with semicircular
arches; there are three bridges exactly
alike, for each time an emperor passes, dead or
alive, the middle bridge is reserved for him alone.
The architects of the tombs were careful to have
the avenue crossed several times by artificial
streams, in order to have an occasion for spanning
them with these charming curves of everlasting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
white. On each rail of the bridge there is an intertwining
of imperial fancies. The sloping pavement
is white and slippery, and completely framed
in grass, which pushes through and flourishes in
all its joinings.</p>

<p>The crossing is dangerously slippery for our
horses, whose steps resound mournfully on the
marble; the sudden noise we make in the stillness
is almost a source of embarrassment to us, making
us feel as though our coming had disturbed in an
unseemly manner the composure of the necropolis.
With the exception of ourselves and a few
ravens in the trees, nothing moves and nothing
lives in all the immensity of this memorial
park.</p>

<p>Beyond the three arched bridges the avenue leads
to the first temple, with a yellow enamelled roof,
which seems to bar our way. At the four corners
of the open space it occupies, rise four rostral columns
made of marble, white as ivory,&mdash;admirable
monoliths, with a crouching animal at the top of
each one, similar to those enthroned on the obelisks
in front of the palace at Pekin,&mdash;a sort of
slender jackal, with long, erect ears, upturned eyes,
and a mouth open as if howling to heaven. This
first temple contains nothing but three giant stele,
resting on marble turtles as large as leviathans.
They recount the glory of a defunct emperor; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
first is inscribed in the Tartar language, the second
in Chinese, the third in Manchou.</p>

<p>Beyond this temple of stele the avenue is prolonged
in the same direction for an indefinite
length, very majestic with its two walls of black-green
cedars, and its carpet of grass, flowers,
and moss, which looks as though it were never
trampled upon. All the avenues in these woods
are always thus deserted, always silent, for the
Chinese come here only at rare intervals, in solemn,
respectful processions to perform their funeral
rites. And it is the air of desertion in the midst
of splendor which is the great charm of this place,
unique in all the world.</p>

<p>When the Allies have left China, this park of
tombs, open to us for a single moment, will be once
more impenetrable for how long we do not know;
perhaps until another invasion, which may cause
the venerable yellow Colossus to crumble away,&mdash;unless,
indeed, it awakes from its slumber of a
thousand years; for the Colossus is still capable
of spreading terror, and of arming itself for a
revenge of which one dares not think&mdash;<i>Mon
Dieu!</i> the day when China, in the place of its small
regiments of mercenaries and bandits, shall arm
in mass for a supreme revolt its millions of young
peasants such as I have recently seen, sober, cruel,
spare, muscular, accustomed to every sort of physical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
exercise, and defiant of death, what a terrifying
army it will have, if modern instruments
of destruction are placed in their hands! On
reflection, it seems as though certain of the Allies
have been rather rash to have sown here so many
seeds of hatred, and to have created so much desire
for vengeance.</p>

<p>Now, at the end of the dark deserted green
avenue the final temple shows its shining roof.
The mountain above, the strange, crenellated mountain,
which has been chosen as a sort of background
for all this sad creation, rises to-day all
violet and rose against a bit of rare blue sky,&mdash;the
blue of a turquoise turning to green. The light
continues to be modified, exquisite; the sun is
veiled by the same clouds that in color remind one
of turtle-doves, and we no longer hear our horses'
steps, so thick is the carpet of grass and moss.</p>

<p>Now one catches sight of the great triple doors
of the sanctuary; they are blood-red with hinges
of gold. Then comes the whiteness of three marble
bridges with slippery pavements, in crossing which
my little army makes an exaggerated noise, as
though the rows of cedars ranged like a wall on
either side of us had the sonority of a church.
From here on, as if to guard the ever more sacred
approach, tall marble statues are lined up on each
side of the avenue. We pass between motionless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
elephants, horses, lions, and mute white warriors,
three times the height of man.</p>

<p>As we approach the white terraces of the temple
we begin to perceive the ravages of war. The
German soldiers, who were here before ours, tore
out in places, with the points of their swords, the
beautiful gilded bronze decorations of the red
doors, taking them to be gold.</p>

<p>In the first court of one of the lateral edifices,
whose roofs are as sumptuously enamelled as those
of the big sanctuary, are the kitchens,&mdash;where are
prepared at certain times repasts for the Shadow
of Death,&mdash;extensive enough to provide for a
legion of ogres or vampires. Enormous ovens,
enormous bronze troughs in which whole oxen are
cooked, are still intact; but the pavement is littered
with broken porcelains, with fragments which are
the result of a blow with the butt end of a gun or
a bayonet.</p>

<p>On a high terrace, after passing two or three
courts paved with marble, after two or three enclosures
entered by triple doors of cedar, the central
temple opens before us, empty and devastated.
It is magnificent in its proportions, with tall columns
of red and gold lacquer, but it has been despoiled
of its sacred riches. Heavy silk hangings,
idols, silver drinking-vessels, flat silver dishes for
the feasts of the Shades had almost entirely disappeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
when the French arrived, and what remained
of the treasures has been collected in a
safe place by our officers. Two of them have just
been decorated by the Emperor of China for this
preservation of property, and it is one of the most
curious episodes of this abnormal war, the sovereign
of the invaded country spontaneously decorating
the officers of the invading army out of
gratitude. Behind the last temple is the colossal
tomb.</p>

<p>For the interment of an emperor the Chinese
cut a piece out of a hill as one would cut out a
portion from a Titanic cake; then they isolate
it by enormous excavations and surround it with
crenellated ramparts. It thus becomes a massive
citadel. Then in the bowels of the earth they dig
a sepulchral passageway known only to the initiated,
and at its end they place the emperor, not
mummified, but in a thick coffin made of cedar
lacquered in gold, which must prevent rapid disintegration.
Then they seal forever the subterranean
door by a kind of screen of faience,
invariably yellow and green, with relief representing
the lotus, dragons, or clouds. Each sovereign
in his turn is buried and sealed up in the
same manner,&mdash;in the midst of a forest region
equally vast and equally solitary.</p>

<p>At last we arrive at the end of this section of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
hill and of this rampart, stopped in our course by
a melancholy screen of yellow and green faience,
which seems to be the end of our forty-league
journey. It is a square screen, twenty feet each
way, brilliant with color and varnish, and in striking
contrast to the gray brick wall and gray earth.</p>

<p>The ravens are massed here as though they
divined the sinister thing concealed from them in
the heart of the mountain, and receive us with a
chorus of cries.</p>

<p>Opposite the faience screen is an altar of rough-hewn
marble, whose brutal simplicity is in striking
contrast to the splendors of the temple and
the avenue. It supports a sort of incense burner
of unknown and tragic significance, and two or
three symbolic articles intentionally rude in workmanship.
One is confounded by the strange forms,
the almost primitive barbarity of these last and
supreme objects at the threshold of the tomb;
their aspect is intended to create a sort of indefinable
terror. I remember once, in the holy
mountain at Nikko, where sleep the emperors of
old Japan, that after the fairy-like magnificence
of gold-lacquered temples, outside the little bronze
door which forms the entrance to each sepulture,
I stumbled against just such an altar, supporting
two or three worn emblems, as disturbing as these
in their artificial barbaric <i>naïveté</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>It seems that in these subterranean passages of
the Son of Heaven there are heaps of treasures,
precious stones, and metals. Those who are authorities
in Chinese matters assured our generals
that enough would be found about the body of a
single emperor to pay the war indemnity demanded
by Europe, and that the mere threat of
violating one of these ancestral tombs would
suffice to bring the Regent and her son to
Pekin submissive and yielding, ready to make
all concessions.</p>

<p>Happily for our Occidental honor, no one of
the Allies would consent to this means, so the
yellow and green faience screens have not been
broken; every dragon, every lotus, no matter
how delicate in relief, has remained intact. All
have paused here. The old emperors, behind their
everlasting walls, may have heard the approach of
the trumpets of the barbarian army and the beating
of their drums, but each one of them could
fall asleep again, tranquil as before, surrounded
by the empty glory of his fabulous wealth.</p>

<h2>VIII<br />
THE LAST DAYS OF PEKIN</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Pekin</span>, Wednesday May 1.<br />
</div>

<p>I returned yesterday from my visit to
the tombs of the emperors after three days
and a half of journeying in the haze created
by the "yellow wind," beneath a heavy sun constantly
obscured by the dust. I am back once
more in Pekin, with our chief general, in my old
rooms in the Palace of the North. Yesterday the
thermometer registered 40° in the shade, to-day
only 8° (a difference of 32° in twenty-four
hours). An icy wind drives the rain-drops that
are mingled with a few white flakes, and the
neighboring mountains behind the Summer Palace
are quite covered with snow. Yet there are
people in France who complain of our springs!</p>

<p>Now that my expedition is over, I ought at
once to go back to Taku and the squadron, but
the general wants me to stay for a great fête he
is to give to the staff officers of the allied armies,
and so I have telegraphed to the admiral, asking
for three days more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<span class="smcap">The Lake and Southern View of Summer Palace</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>In the evening I walk on the esplanade of the
Rotunda Palace in company with Colonel Marchand.
The weather is bad, stormy, and cold, and
the twilight comes on too early on account of the
rapidly moving clouds. As the wind parts them
one gets glimpses of the mountains behind the
Summer Palace, snowy white against a background
of dark clouds.</p>

<p>Confusion reigns about us, but it is the confusion
of a fête instead of that incidental to battle
and death, as I had known it here last autumn.
Zouaves and African chasseurs are running about,
carrying ladders, draperies, and armfuls of branches
and flowers. The old cedars in the vicinity of the
beautiful pagoda shining with enamel, lacquer, and
gold, are disguised until they look like fruit-trees;
upon their almost sacred branches are thousands
of yellow balls that look like big oranges. Chains
supporting garlands of Chinese lanterns go from
one to the other.</p>

<p>It is Colonel Marchand who has planned it all.
"Do you think it will be pretty? Do you think
it will be a little unusual? You see, I want to do
it better than the others."</p>

<p>The others were the Germans, the Americans,
and all the rest of the Allies who have given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
these fêtes before the French. So my new friend
has been in the most feverish state of activity for
five or six days, in attempting to do something
that has never been done before, working far into
the night with his men, who share his enthusiasm,
putting into this play-work the same passionate
effort he put into conducting his little army across
Africa. From time to time, though, his smile
betrays that he is finding amusement in all this,
and will not take its possible failure tragically, if
wind and snow come to upset the fairyland of his
dreams.</p>

<p>No, but this cold is annoying all the same!
What shall we do, since it is to take place in the
open air on the terraces of the palace, if the north
wind should blow? What of the illuminations,
of the awnings? And the women, won't they
freeze in their evening gowns? For there are
women even here in the heart of the Yellow City.</p>

<p>Suddenly a gust of wind breaks down a whole
string of lanterns with pearl pendants, which are
already hung from the branches of the old cedars,
and upsets a row of the flower-pots, which have
been brought up here by the hundreds to give life
to these old gardens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Thursday</span>, May 2.<br />
</div>

<p>Messengers have been sent to the four corners
of Pekin, announcing that this evening's fête has
been postponed until Saturday, in the hope that
the bad weather will be over by that time. So I
have had to send a despatch, asking the admiral
for a prolongation of my freedom. I came away
for three days and have remained almost a month,
and am wearing shirts and waistcoats borrowed
here and there from my various army friends.</p>

<p>This morning I have the honor of breakfasting
with our neighbor in the Yellow City, Marshal
von Waldersee.</p>

<p>Covers are laid for the marshal and his staff
in a large room finished in marquetry and carvings,
in a part of the palace untouched by the
flames. They are all correctly attired in irreproachable
military garb in the midst of this fantastically
Chinese setting.</p>

<p>It is the first time in my life that I have sat
down at a table with German officers, and I had
not anticipated the pang of anguish with which I
arrived among them as a guest. Oh, the memories
of thirty years ago, and the special aspects
which that terrible year had for me!</p>

<p>That long winter of 1870 was passed in a
wretched little boat on the coast of Prussia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
How well I remember my watch on the cold
decks,&mdash;child that I was, almost,&mdash;and the silhouette
of a certain <i>King William</i> that so often
appeared on the horizon in pursuit of us, at the
sight of which we always fled, its balls whizzing
behind us over the icy waters. Then the despair
of feeling that our small part there had been so
useless and unavailing! We knew nothing about
it until long afterward; news came seldom, and
when it did come it was in little sealed papers
that we opened tremblingly. Over each fresh
disaster, over each new story of German cruelty,
what rage filled our hearts,&mdash;childlike in the
excess of their violence,&mdash;what vows we made
among ourselves never to forget! All this came
to me pell-mell, or rather a rapid synthesis of it
all, on the very threshold of this breakfast-room,
even before I had crossed the sill, from the mere
sight of the pointed helmets that hung along the
wall, and I felt like going away.</p>

<p>But I did not, and the feeling disappeared in
the dark backward and abysm of time. Their
welcome, their handshakes, and their smiles of
good fellowship made me forget it in a second,
for the moment at least. At any rate, it seems
that there is not between them and us that racial
antipathy which is less easily overcome than the
sharp rancor of war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>During breakfast this Chinese palace of theirs,
accustomed to the sound of gongs and flutes,
echoes to the strains of "Lohengrin" or the
"Rheingold," played in the distance by their military
band. The white-haired marshal was good
enough to give me a seat near him, and, like all
of our people who have had the honor to come
under his influence, I felt the charm of his exquisite
distinction of manner, of his kindness and
goodness.</p>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Friday</span>, May 3.<br />
</div>

<p>More and more people are coming back to
Pekin, until it is almost as crowded as of yore.
The people are very much occupied with funerals.
Last summer the Chinese here were killing one
another; now they are burying one another.
Every family has kept its dead in the house for
months, according to their custom, in thick cedar
coffins, which somewhat modify the odor of decay;
they bring the dead their daily meals as well as
presents; they burn red wax candles for them;
they give them music; they play the flute and the
gong in the continual fear of not paying them
enough honor and of incurring their vengeance
and their ill will. The time has come now to take
them to their graves, with processions a kilometre
long, with more flutes and gongs, innumerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
lanterns and gilded emblems, which they hire at
high prices; they ruin themselves for monuments
and offerings; they scarcely sleep for fear of seeing
their dead return. I do not remember who it
was who described China as "a country where a
few hundred millions of living Chinese are dominated
and terrorized by a few thousand millions
of dead ones." Tombs everywhere and of every
form; one sees nothing else on the plains of Pekin.
As for all the thickets of cedar, pine, and arbor-vitæ,
they are nothing but funeral parks, walled
in by double or triple walls, a single park often
being consecrated to one person, thus cutting the
living off from an enormous amount of space.</p>

<p>A defunct Lama, whom I visited to-day, occupies
on his own account a space two or three kilometres
square. The old trees in his park, scarcely leafed
out as yet, give little shade from the sun, which
is already dangerously hot. In the centre of it is
a marble mausoleum,&mdash;a pyramidal structure with
small figures and masses of white carvings which
taper skyward, terminating in gilt tips. Scattered
about under the cedars are crumbling old temples,
built long ago to the memory of this holy man,
enclosing in their obscurity a whole population of
gilded idols that are turning to dust. Just outside,
the cindery soil where no one ever walks, is
strewn with the resinous cones from the trees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
and with the black feathers of the crows, who inhabit
this silent place by the hundreds. As in the
imperial woods, April has brought out a few violet
gillyflowers and a quantity of very small iris of
the same color.</p>

<p>All the woods which are used for burial places&mdash;and
the country is encumbered with them&mdash;resemble
this one, and contain the same old temples,
the same idols, and the same crows.</p>

<p>The plains of Petchili are an immense necropolis,
where the living tremble lest they offend one
of the innumerable dead.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Pekin is not only being repeopled, but rebuilt;
hastily though, out of small blackened bricks
from the ruins, so that the new streets will probably
never display the luxurious façades, the lacy,
gilded woodwork of former times.</p>

<p>The great eastern artery that crosses the Tartar
City is, of all the streets of old Pekin, the
nearest to what it used to be; life here is becoming
intense, the people swarm. For the length of
a league this avenue, which is fifty metres wide,&mdash;of
magnificent proportions, although now very
much injured,&mdash;is invaded by thousands of platforms,
sheds, tents, or in some cases simply umbrellas
stuck in the ground, where the people who
serve horrible drinks and food dispense their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
wares, always in delicate China very much decorated;
there are charlatans, acupuncturers, Punch-and-Judy
shows, musicians, and story-tellers. The
crowd is divided into an infinite number of currents
by all these small shops and theatres, like
the waters of a river filled with islands, so that
there is a constant eddy of human heads black
with dust and filth. Rough, hoarse vociferations,
in a quality of voice unfamiliar to our ears, are
heard on all sides, to an accompaniment of grating
violins, noisy gongs and bells. The caravans
of enormous Mongolian camels, which all winter
encumber the streets in endless processions, have
disappeared in the solitudes of the North, together
with their flat-faced drivers, who wish to escape
the torrid heat; but their place in the central part
of the street, reserved for animals and vehicles, is
taken by numerous small horses and tiny carriages,
and the cracking of whips is heard on all sides.</p>

<p>On the ground in front of the houses, spread
out upon the mud and filth, the extravagant rag-fair
that began last autumn is still going on; the
remains of so much pillage and burning are left
that it seems as though there was no end to them,&mdash;magnificently
embroidered clothing spotted with
blood, Buddhas, grotesque figures, jewels, dead
men's wigs, cracked vases, or precious fragments
of jade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>Behind all these ridiculous things, behind all this
dusty display, the greater number of the houses, in
contrast with the poverty-stricken appearance of
the crowds, seem astonishingly rich in carvings
and decorations,&mdash;a mass of openwork and fine
gilding from top to bottom. Indefatigable artists,
with the Chinese patience and skill which confound
us, have carved crowds of little figures, monsters,
and birds in the midst of flowers, and trees on
which you can count the leaves.</p>

<p>Last summer, while the Boxers were burning
so continually, these astonishing façades, representing
an incalculable amount of human labor,
were consumed by the hundreds; they made Pekin
a veritable museum of carving and gold, the like
of which men of to-day will never again have the
time to construct.</p>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Saturday</span>, May 4.<br />
</div>

<p>The fête given by our general to the staff officers
of the Allies is really coming off to-night. But
before this we are to have a celebration among ourselves:
the inauguration of a new boulevard in our
quarter, from the Marble Bridge to the Yellow
Gate,&mdash;a long boulevard whose construction was
entrusted to Colonel Marchand, and which is to
bear the name of our general. Never since the
far-distant epoch when her network of paved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
avenues was laid out has Pekin seen such a thing,&mdash;a
straight, level roadway, without ruts or
humps, where carriages may drive rapidly between
two rows of young trees.</p>

<p>There is a great crowd to assist at this inauguration.
On both sides of the new, freshly gravelled,
and still empty avenue&mdash;barred off by sentinels
and ropes from one end to the other&mdash;all our
soldiers are lined up, with a sprinkling of German
soldiers too, for they are quite neighborly with
ours, and a few Chinese, both men and women, in
festive array. Quaint, charming babies, with cat-like
eyes that slant upward toward the temple,
occupy the first row, directly behind the rope; our
soldiers are carrying some of them so that they
may see better, and one big Zouave is walking up
and down with two Chinese children, three or four
years old, one on each shoulder. There are people
on the roofs, too,&mdash;many of the convalescents are
standing about on the tiled roof of our hospital,
and some African chasseurs, seeking a choice place,
have climbed the Gothic tower of the church,
which, with the big tricolored flag floating in the
breeze, dominates the entire scene.</p>

<p>There are French flags over all the Chinese
doors, and they are arranged in groups, like trophies,
with lanterns and garlands on all the poles.
It is like a sort of foreign exotic Fourteenth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
July; if it were in France the decorations would
be commonplace; but here, in Pekin, they are
touching and fine, especially when the military
band arrives, and the "Marseillaise" bursts forth.</p>

<p>The inauguration consists simply of a sort of
charge, executed on the fresh gravel by all the
French officers, from the Yellow Gate to the other
extremity of the boulevard, where the general
awaits them on a balcony trimmed with garlands
of green, and smilingly offers them champagne.
Then the frail barriers are removed, the crowd
disperses gaily, the children with the cat-like eyes
trudge off over the well-rolled avenue, and all is
over.</p>

<p>When we have all returned to France, and Pekin
is again in the hands of the Chinese, I fear that this
Avenue du Général-Vayron&mdash;though they now appear
to appreciate it&mdash;will not last two winters.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Eight o'clock in the evening. The long May twilight
is almost over, and the curious lanterns, some
of glass with long strings of pearls, others of rice-paper
in the form of birds or of lotus blossoms, are
everywhere lighted among the old cedar branches
on the esplanade of the Rotunda Palace, which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
had known plunged in such a melancholy abyss of
sadness and silence. To-night all is movement,
life, gay light. Already uniformed officers of all
the nations of Europe, and Chinese, in long silken
robes, with official head-dresses from which depend
peacock feathers, are going and coming amid the
wonderful decorations. A table for seventy is
set under a tent, and we are awaiting our incongruous
assembly of guests.</p>

<p>Followed by small suites, they arrive from all
quarters of Pekin, some on horseback, others in
carriages, in chairs, or in sumptuous palanquins.
As soon as any person of distinction appears at the
lower door of the inclined plane, one of our military
band, who is on the lookout, orders the playing
of the national air of his country. The Russian
Hymn follows the German, or the Japanese the
march of the Bersaglieri. Even the Chinese air
is heard, for some one pompously enters with a
large red paper, which proves to be the visiting-card
of Li-Hung-Chang, who is below, but who,
in accordance with the etiquette of his country,
is announced before he makes his appearance.
Preceded by similar cards, the Chief-Justice of
Pekin and the Representative Extraordinary of the
Empress are the next to arrive. These Chinese
princes, who are to assist at our fête, come in gala
palanquins, with a cavalry escort, and they make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
their entrance with the most inscrutable expressions
on their faces, followed by a band of servants
dressed in silk. It was hard to have them! But
Colonel Marchand, with the general's permission,
made it a point of honor to invite them. Mixed
in with our Western uniforms, mandarins' robes
and pointed hats with the coral button are numerous.
Their presence at this barbarian feast right
in the heart of the Imperial City, which we have
profaned, will remain one of the most singular inconsistencies
of our time.</p>

<p>Such a length of table as there is,&mdash;its legs
resting on an imperial carpet which seems to be
made of thick yellow velvet! Bunches of flowers
are arranged in priceless, gigantic old cloisonné
vases that have been taken out of the reserves of
the Empress for a single night. Marshal von
Waldersee, with the wife of the French minister
at his side, occupies the seat of honor; then two
bishops in violet robes, the generals and officers of
the seven allied nations, five or six women in
evening dress, and, lastly, the three great princes
of China, so enigmatical in their embroidered silks,
their eyes partly concealed by their ceremonial hats
and falling plumes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At the close of this strange dinner, when the
roses in the big, precious vases are beginning to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
hang their heads, our general, toward the close of
his toast, turns to the Yellow Princes: "Your
presence here among us," he says, "is a sufficient
proof that we did not come here to make war
against China, but only against an abominable
sect," etc.</p>

<p>Then the Empress's representative takes up the
ball with a suppleness characteristic of the far
East, and, without turning a hair, replies (he
was secretly a furious Boxer): "In the name of
Her Imperial Chinese Majesty, I thank the generous
nations of Europe for having extended a
helping hand to our government in one of the
gravest crises it has ever passed through."</p>

<p>A stupefied silence follows, and then glasses are
emptied.</p>

<p>During the banquet the esplanade is filled with
many uniformed and gaily dressed persons, of all
sorts and colors, who are invited for the evening.
The toasts having come to an end with the reply of
the Chinese, I lean over the edge of the terrace to
watch from on high and from afar the lighting
up of the entire place below.</p>

<p>Coming out from under the awnings and the
cedar branches, which obscure the view, it is a surprise
and a delight to see the borders of the lake
and the melancholy, silent landscape,&mdash;in ordinary
times dark, disturbing, ghostly places as soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
as night approaches,&mdash;as the lights come on as if
for some fantastic apotheosis.</p>

<p>Soldiers have been stationed in all the old palaces
and temples that are scattered amongst the trees,
and in less than an hour, by climbing along the
enamelled tiles, they have lighted innumerable red
lanterns, which form lines of fire, outlining the
curves of the multiple-storied roofs and emphasizing
the Chinese characteristic of the architecture
and the eccentricity of the miradors and towers.
All along the tragic lake where the bodies still lie,
concealed in the grass, is a row of lights; and as
far as one can see the entire shadowy park, so
ruined and desolate, creates an illusion of gaiety.
The old dungeon on the Island of Jade throws out
bright rays and blue fire. The Empress's gondolas,
so long stationary, and more or less damaged, are
out to-night on the reflecting waters, which, with
the lights, remind one of Venice. For a single
night an appearance of life pervades these phantoms
of real things. And all this, never seen
before, will never be seen again.</p>

<p>What an astounding contrast with what I used
to see when I was alone in this palace in the autumn
twilight! Along the lake groups of people in ball
dress instead of corpses,&mdash;my only neighbors
last year,&mdash;and the soft mildness of this May
night instead of the glacial cold with which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
used to shiver as soon as the sun began to go
down.</p>

<p>In the foreground, at the entrance to the Marble
Bridge, the great Arc de Triomphe of China, resplendent
with gilding, shines out against the
evening sky, its values all emphasized by a profusion
of lights. Then the bridge across the lake is
much lighted, although it seems luminous itself
in its eternal whiteness. In the distance the whole
phantasmagoria&mdash;empty palaces and pagodas&mdash;emerges
from the obscurity of the trees, and is reflected
in the water in lines of fire.</p>

<p>Our five hundred guests are scattered about in
sympathetic groups on the borders of the lake beneath
the spring-like verdure of the willows, along
the Marble Bridge or in the imperial gondolas.
As they come down from the terrace they are given
gaily decorated lanterns on little sticks, so that
after a time these balls of color, scattered along
the paths, seem from a distance like a company of
glow-worms.</p>

<p>From where I stand women in light evening
wraps may be seen on the arms of officers, crossing
the white paving-stones of the bridge, or
seated in the stern of the long imperial barques,
softly propelled by the oarsmen. How strange it
seems to see these Europeans, almost all of whom
underwent the tortures of the siege, walking quietly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
about in dinner dress in the retreat of the sovereigns
who had secretly conspired to kill them!</p>

<p>Decidedly the place has lost all its horrors;
there is so much light, so many people, so many
soldiers, that all the vague forms of ghosts and
evil spirits have been driven away for the night.</p>

<p>Something like approaching thunder is heard in
the distance, which proves to be the noise of about
fifty tambourines announcing the arrival of the
procession. It was to form at the Yellow Gate,
so as to follow the line of the new avenue, and to
disband at the foot of the Rotunda Palace. The
lights of the first division appear at the entrance
of the Marble Bridge, and begin to cross its magnificent
white archway. Cavalry, infantry, and
music, all seem to be rolling on in our direction,
with enough noise from the brasses and the tambourines
to make the sepulchral walls of the Violet
City tremble, while above the heads of the thousands
of soldiers groups and rows of extravagantly
Chinese colored lanterns are swinging to
the movement of the horses' hoofs or to the
rhythm of human shoulders.</p>

<p>The troops have passed, but the procession is
not nearly over. A sharp, delirious noise that gets
on one's nerves follows the marches played by our
musicians,&mdash;the noise of gongs, zithers, cymbals,
bells. At the same time gigantic green and yellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
banners, curiously slashed and of unusual proportions,
begin to appear on the Marble Bridge, borne
by an advancing company of tall, slender persons,
with astonishing underpinnings, who are swinging
along like bears. They prove to be my stilt-walkers
from Y-Tchou and from Laï-Chou-Chien
from the vicinity of the tombs, who have taken a
three or four days' journey in order to participate
in this French fête!</p>

<p>Behind them a crescendo of gongs, cymbals,
and other diabolical Chinese instruments, announces
the arrival of the dragons,&mdash;red and
green beasts twenty metres long. In some way
or other they are lighted from within, which by
night gives them an incandescent appearance;
above the heads of the crowds they twist and undulate
like the sulphurescent serpents in a Buddhist
hell. The entire scene reflected in the water&mdash;the
outline of palace and pagoda with their multiple
roofs&mdash;is emphasized by lines of red lights
that shine brightly this moonless and cloudy night.</p>

<p>When the big serpents have gone past, the
Marble Bridge continues to pour at our feet a
stream of humanity, although an irregular one,
which moves tumultuously along with a formidable
noise. It is the rest of our troops, the free
soldiers following the procession with lanterns,
also singing the "Marseillaise," or the "Sambre-et-Meuse,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
at the top of their lungs. Along with
them are German soldiers arm-in-arm with them,
increasing the volume of sound by adding their
voices to the others, and singing with all their
might the old French songs.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Midnight. The myriads of little red lanterns
on the cornices of the old palace and pagodas have
burned themselves out. Obscurity and the usual
silence have come back to the lake and to the imperial
woods. The Chinese princes have discreetly
withdrawn, followed by their silk-robed attendants,
and have been borne far away in their palanquins
to their own dwellings in another part of the
shadowy city.</p>

<p>It is now time for the cotillon, after a ball that
was necessarily short,&mdash;a ball that seemed an
impossibility, for there were scarcely a dozen dancing
women, even including a pretty little twelve-year-old
girl and her governess, to five hundred
dancing men. It took place in the beautiful gilt
pagoda, converted for the night into a ball-room;
the dancers occupied the centre of the great empty
space beneath the downcast gaze of the big alabaster
goddess in the golden robes, who was my
companion of last summer in the solitude of this
same palace, together with a certain yellow and
white cat. Poor goddess! A bed of natural iris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
has been arranged for the evening at her feet, and
the injured background of her altar draped in blue
satin, against the magnificent folds of which her
figure stands out in ideal whiteness; her golden
dress, embroidered with sparkling stones, shows
to great advantage.</p>

<p>In spite of all effort to light this sanctuary and
to decorate it with lanterns in the form of flowers
and birds, it is too freakish a place for a ball-room.
It is impossible to light up the corners and
the gilded arches of the ceiling, and the presiding
goddess is so mysteriously pale as to be embarrassing
with that smile of hers, which seems to
pity the puerility of our Occidental hopping and
skipping; her eyes are downcast, that she may
not see. This feeling of embarrassment is not
peculiar to myself, for the young woman who is
leading the cotillon, seized by some sudden fancy,
leaves the room, taking with her the tambourine
she is using in the figure that has just begun, and
is followed by both dancers and onlookers, so that
the temple is emptied, and our poor little cotillon,
languidly continued for a time in the open air,
comes to an end under the cedars of the esplanade,
where a few lanterns are still burning.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One o'clock in the morning. Most of the guests
have departed, having far to go in the darkness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
before reaching their dwellings. A few of the
particularly faithful among the "Allies" remain,
it is true, around the buffet where the champagne
continues to flow, and the toasts to France grow
warmer and warmer.</p>

<p>I was about to go off alone to my own palace,
not far away, and was, in fact, already on the inclined
plane leading to the Lake of the Lotus, when
some one called out: "Wait for me; it will rest
me to go along with you."</p>

<p>It was Colonel Marchand, and we walked along
together over the Marble Bridge. The great winding
sheet of silence and of night has fallen upon
the Imperial City that had been filled for a single
evening with music and light.</p>

<p>"Well," he questioned, "how did it go? what
was your impression of it all?" And I replied
as I felt,&mdash;that it was magnificently unusual, in
a setting absolutely unparalleled.</p>

<p>Yet my friend Marchand seems rather depressed,
and we scarcely speak, except for the
occasional word that suffices between friends.
There was, for one thing, the feeling of melancholy
that comes from the fading away into the
past of an event&mdash;futile though it was&mdash;which
had brought us a few days' distraction from the
preoccupations of life; and more than all this,
there was another feeling, common to us both,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
which we understood almost without words as
our heels clicked on the marble pavement in the
silence that from moment to moment grew more
solemn. It seemed to us that this evening had
commemorated in a way the irremediable downfall
of Pekin, or rather the downfall of a people.
Whatever happens now, even though the remarkable
Asiatic court comes back here, which seems
improbable, Pekin is over, its prestige gone, its
mysteries are open to the light of day.</p>

<p>Yet this Imperial City was one of the last
refuges on earth of the marvellous and the unknown,
one of the last bulwarks of a humanity
so old as to be incomprehensible&mdash;nay, almost
fabulous&mdash;to men of our times.</p>
